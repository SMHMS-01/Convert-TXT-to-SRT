00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:27,0000
Hello, dear guests. Dear guests, friends, welcome to Ljubljana in Cukrana to the final evening of Indigo Festival.

3
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,0000
Tonight, I have a pleasure to invite you to our stage two important thinkers,

4
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:41,0000
philosopher Slava Zizek from Ljubljana, Slovenia, and Janis Varoufakis, economist and professor from Athens, Greece.

5
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,0000
I think that both of them I do not need to present individually.

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:58,0000
In this evening, we will follow conversation between them and we will surely hear what is political moment of Europe and in world stage.

7
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,0000
What are the paths and problems of nowadays left movements?

8
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,0000
How is pandemic times influence on our, let's say, hypnotic times?

9
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:16,0000
Conversation will last approximately one hour and a half and will be in English language.

10
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,0000
After conversation, they will answer to couple of questions, both of them.

11
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,0000
Dear Slava, dear Janis, the floor is yours.

12
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:35,0000
[Applause]

13
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,0000
It works too much even. Okay. Thank you very much.

14
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:46,0000
I'm glad to be here with my good friend Janis and those who know me know very well what do I mean by good friends,

15
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:53,0000
that he voluntarily accepts all my dirty jokes and so on.

16
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,0000
Even enjoy them.

17
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,0000
I thought always that masochism is a feminine category, but okay, that's another point.

18
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,0000
Okay, now more seriously.

19
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:17,0000
The reason I accepted this talk is that what we need in these days, I think, more than ever is what?

20
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:24,0000
The great philosopher of enlightenment, Immanuel Kant, called public use of reason.

21
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,0000
He opposes, as some of you maybe know, public use of reason to private use of reason.

22
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:40,0000
But in what way? For Kant, state administration, theological faculty, faculty of law, this is private use of reason,

23
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,0000
because it serves preordained order, state interests and so on.

24
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:55,0000
While if we meet just to debate something, thinking really it is public use of reason,

25
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:03,0000
and public use of reason is what is under threat, what is disappearing today.

26
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:13,0000
Public use of reason means not just to think, but to reflect on thinking itself.

27
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,0000
Don't be afraid, I will give you a simple example.

28
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:28,0000
Here in Slovenia a couple of days ago, I saw on TV a report on those anti-COVID measures,

29
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:34,0000
where a lady was saying, "I'm here not for politics. I don't care about politics.

30
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:42,0000
It's only for my freedom and human rights that I am here."

31
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:48,0000
Now, our first act here should be to analyze this term.

32
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,0000
But what do we mean by freedom? In what conditions is it possible to be free?

33
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,0000
What do we mean by politics?

34
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:08,0000
Following my good friend, Alenka Zupancic, I would like to paraphrase her what she said in a recent interview,

35
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,0000
that we all talk about politics of emancipation.

36
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:23,0000
But what we need today is also emancipation of politics, in the sense that we don't need less politics.

37
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:29,0000
We need more engaged politics.

38
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:37,0000
Because are you aware that when you have this cynical attitude, politics is a whore who cares about it,

39
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,0000
just mind your own business?

40
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:46,0000
This is, I think, the stance which fits perfectly those in power.

41
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,0000
So that's why we are here.

42
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:58,0000
And I would just like to begin to approach in Greece with a difference, which - and then immediately I give you the word -

43
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:07,0000
which shows nicely the superiority of Greek civilization over our Slovenian civilization.

44
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:16,0000
Recently I read that we discovered some doctors who you pay three, four hundred euros, you get a fake vaccine.

45
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,0000
We have those too.

46
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,0000
Yeah, but as I am informed, is it true or not?

47
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:30,0000
With a difference, your doctors did something wonderful and that's where I support them.

48
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,0000
You know what they did?

49
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:38,0000
Okay, you are opposed to vaccination, you pay four hundred and they give you something,

50
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,0000
they tell you, oh, it's just water, just to go through the...

51
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:50,0000
They discovered that these doctors were giving you real vaccination.

52
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:58,0000
And I think this is how we, when we criticize - and again, we Slovenes are true primitives.

53
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:05,0000
When I hear anecdotes like that, I understand why Greeks are the origin of Western civilization.

54
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,0000
But more seriously...

55
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,0000
No, no, no, sorry, I will immediately finish.

56
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,0000
We are the inventors of mythology.

57
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,0000
Sorry?

58
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,0000
We are the inventors of mythology.

59
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,0000
This is a great myth, a very instructive myth, but I fear it is a myth.

60
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:27,0000
No, but what I really want to say is that the reason I like this story is that it has a very important lesson for our...

61
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,0000
Now I am slowly getting serious.

62
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:39,0000
For our situation today, that the way the power mechanisms enslave you is not counting on your naivety,

63
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,0000
but counting precisely on your distrust.

64
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,0000
That's how conspiracy theories work.

65
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,0000
Don't trust those in power.

66
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:54,0000
For example, with pandemic, the motto of skeptics is "Do your own research".

67
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,0000
What does this mean?

68
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:03,0000
That you go to Google and put it on search and of course get as many conspiracy theories as you want?

69
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,0000
So what I'm saying is that...

70
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,0000
I think I even read somewhere this...

71
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:16,0000
The British, the English, whatever, have this wonderful expression "lamp to slaughter".

72
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:22,0000
That you don't have to catch the lamp, it voluntarily waits in line.

73
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,0000
That's how ideology works today.

74
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,0000
It takes into account our skeptical distance and so on and so on.

75
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,0000
Short introduction, finished now.

76
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,0000
I ask the question.

77
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,0000
If you want, it's more like what they call in detective movies a third degree.

78
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,0000
You can get stronger.

79
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,0000
Because light...

80
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,0000
The Gestapo light.

81
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,0000
Gestapo, yes.

82
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,0000
Because questions will be serious.

83
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,0000
The first one, Syriza.

84
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,0000
We know, you were almost to the end, finance minister and so on.

85
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,0000
We know what happened.

86
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,0000
Just to remind you.

87
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,0000
On the one hand it was the demands of the European Union.

88
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,0000
Accept our conditions and so on.

89
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,0000
On the other hand, the Grexit guys.

90
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,0000
Let's do the revolution, let's step out and so on.

91
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,0000
And you...

92
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:24,0000
Now, we, by we I mean enlightened public all around Europe who were on your side.

93
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:31,0000
We were all the time, maybe naively, believing that you...

94
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:37,0000
Now, not you personally, but the whole gang of Syriza, that you had a B plan.

95
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,0000
Something secretly to...

96
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,0000
Sorry for the vulgarity to squeeze the testicles of European Union.

97
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:51,0000
Now, we learned lately that after they fired you, that Tsipras and his guys,

98
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,0000
well, they didn't have a B plan.

99
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,0000
They just capitulated.

100
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:05,0000
But you acted at that point as if you had some plan.

101
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:12,0000
You even publicly, now comes the friendly aggressive part, acted as if...

102
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,0000
I remember a couple of interviews, no?

103
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,0000
As if in a couple of days you will see, I will make a deal and so on and so on.

104
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,0000
So, what is your vision?

105
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:29,0000
Did you really have in your mind what, but not in Tony Blair sense, a third way?

106
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:34,0000
You know, like, was there possible to break out of this vicious cycle,

107
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:40,0000
either compromise with European Union or Grexit, simple, brutal Grexit,

108
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,0000
which you convinced me once we talked when you were finance minister,

109
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:51,0000
and you told me that some financial specialist told you that if you do brutally Grexit,

110
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,0000
the standard of living would have fallen for a further 30%,

111
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,0000
that it would have been a catastrophe.

112
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:02,0000
What was your third way, if there was any?

113
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,0000
I mean it seriously, because many people think that you didn't have a third way,

114
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,0000
that you were also bluffing.

115
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:16,0000
There was a plan, I still believe that it was eminently workable and...

116
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,0000
You still believe it?

117
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,0000
I still believe it, I know it. And you know why?

118
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,0000
Because I was told so by my enemies.

119
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,0000
I only believe my enemies, I never believe my friends,

120
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,0000
not because they are not trustworthy people, but usually they don't know.

121
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,0000
They know as much as I know, which is not that much.

122
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,0000
Who are they? Name them.

123
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:41,0000
Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank.

124
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,0000
What was the plan?

125
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,0000
The plan had... I'm not going to speak too long about this,

126
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,0000
because I've written a whole book about it.

127
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,0000
Because you don't really have a plan, no?

128
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,0000
No, no, I did have a plan, it's just I've spoken about it far too often.

129
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:02,0000
And there is a 600 page book on it. But, OK, what was the plan?

130
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,0000
The plan, by the way, Slavoj, was the reason why I was finance minister.

131
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,0000
Because I was not a member of the Syriza party, I never wanted to be a minister,

132
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,0000
I didn't want to be a parliamentarian or a politician for that matter.

133
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,0000
It's just because when Tsipras was about to become prime minister,

134
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,0000
I said to him, "So what are you going to do when they squeeze you?"

135
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,0000
And he said, "I have no idea. Do you have an idea?"

136
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,0000
So I had an idea and I proposed to him the plan.

137
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,0000
And he said, "This is great, but I don't have anybody to implement it.

138
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,0000
You're going to have to be finance minister."

139
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,0000
And I thought, "Oh, shit, I should have kept my mouth shut."

140
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,0000
But then, of course, moral duty, all those bourgeois concepts, right?

141
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,0000
Pushed me to say yes. But what was the plan? The plan was this.

142
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,0000
This is the beginning of 2015.

143
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:57,0000
Draghi, who was in the central bank since the end of 2011,

144
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,0000
spent all the time between 2011 and the beginning of 2015

145
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:06,0000
struggling to create the circumstances for him to buy Italian debt

146
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,0000
because Italy was on the way out.

147
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,0000
3 trillion euros worth of debt.

148
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,0000
If that debt had blown up, the Eurozone would have blown up.

149
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,0000
You wouldn't have euros in your pockets now.

150
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,0000
Germany would have recreated the Deutsche Marker. It's very simple.

151
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:26,0000
So the only thing that saved the euro was that he was going to save

152
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,0000
the Italian state. But he had to go against the German central bank.

153
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,0000
So there was a big clash between Mario Draghi, the European central bank,

154
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,0000
and Jens Weidmann, the head of the Bundesbank, the German central bank.

155
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,0000
They even ended up in court.

156
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:49,0000
The German central bank chief tabled 120 pages of an affidavit

157
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,0000
against Mario Draghi in the European courts.

158
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,0000
It was a huge clash.

159
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:01,0000
So Merkel and Draghi were working against the chief of the Bundesbank.

160
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,0000
We're talking about serious clashes now.

161
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,0000
These are the contradictions of the system, that if you're a tiny little

162
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,0000
pipsqueak finance minister of a tiny pipsqueak country, you have to exploit.

163
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:22,0000
And I thought I had found the weak point of the empire, of the Star Wars spaceship.

164
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,0000
And it was this. The only way Draghi managed to convince the European courts

165
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:35,0000
to allow him to buy Italian debt was if he pledged that he wouldn't allow

166
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:40,0000
one euro of the debt that he purchased to be written down.

167
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:47,0000
Sorry, so that people understand, what do you mean by written down?

168
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:53,0000
Written off. Wiped out. Expunged. Haircut.

169
00:13:53,000 --> 00:14:00,0000
The Greek state owed 29 billion to the central bank.

170
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,0000
These were bonds that the central bank had.

171
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,0000
And they were in Greek law, which meant the finance minister of Greece

172
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,0000
could simply do whatever he wanted with them.

173
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,0000
Say that it would not be paid for another 100 years.

174
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,0000
This is effectively writing it down.

175
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:23,0000
So, a week before the election, I knew we were going to win.

176
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,0000
It was clear from the polls.

177
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:32,0000
In an interview with the BBC, I was just a candidate for a member of parliament,

178
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,0000
formally, right? But I knew I was going to be finance minister if we won.

179
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,0000
In an interview with the BBC, I was asked some irrelevant question,

180
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:48,0000
and on purpose I said I gave an irrelevant answer as a signal to Mario Draghi.

181
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,0000
And it was this. If Syriza wins, and we're in government,

182
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,0000
immediately we're going to get a phone call from Frankfurt,

183
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:02,0000
from the European Central Bank, threatening us with bank closures and squeezing.

184
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:08,0000
The answer should be we're going to write down those 29 billion of debt.

185
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,0000
Because this is what you do. When your central bank squeezes you,

186
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:18,0000
you squeeze them back. And that would impede the purchase of Italian debt.

187
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:24,0000
Cut. Two weeks later, I'm finance minister, and I'm in Frankfurt,

188
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,0000
and I have my first meeting with Mario Draghi.

189
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:33,0000
First thing he says to me, after two hours of boring meetings, rituals and all that,

190
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:40,0000
when we were on one-on-one is, "Please, Yanis, don't mention again those bonds."

191
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:46,0000
And of course we had a dialectic of recognition there, right?

192
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:52,0000
And I said, "I will not do that if you don't shut down my banks."

193
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,0000
Cut again. And this is where my story ends.

194
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:02,0000
Two months later, I learned from within the European Central Bank,

195
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,0000
from a very high-ranking whistleblower, not Mario Draghi himself,

196
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,0000
but somebody very close, that the Greek prime minister, Mike Comrade and friend,

197
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:18,0000
Tsipras, had authorized a message to go through the deputy prime minister to Draghi,

198
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:23,0000
"Don't listen to Varoufakis. We're not going to let him do it."

199
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:28,0000
So there was a plan. It would have worked. There would have been some compromise.

200
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,0000
Of course there would have been a compromise.

201
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:35,0000
We would have to give stuff, but we would get effectively the only thing that I cared for.

202
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:43,0000
The only reason why I became part of this struggle was to get Greeks out of debtor's prison.

203
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,0000
That we would have achieved.

204
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:52,0000
And in the final analysis, so that was plan B, and there was a plan X.

205
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,0000
Plan X was the drachma.

206
00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:00,0000
Because yes, it is true that we would have lost not 30%, 20% of GDP again,

207
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:07,0000
but we would recover it relatively quickly within 18 to 20 months.

208
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:12,0000
Because in the end, at the moment, after all those years,

209
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:18,0000
our income now in Greece is lower than it was in 2015, and our debt is much, much higher,

210
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,0000
and we are a debt colony. We would have stopped being a debt colony.

211
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,0000
So, no regrets for anything.

212
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,0000
Except that I was a bit too lenient with the trica.

213
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:35,0000
Okay. Just two, and then we went to other topics.

214
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,0000
Two, or maybe even just one, how do you call it, sub-question.

215
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,0000
Okay.

216
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,0000
The obvious Stalinist one, who sees conspiracies, that's me.

217
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:49,0000
Why did Tsipras do it? What you said?

218
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:57,0000
Look, I have an ideological objection to giving a shit.

219
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:02,0000
This is between him and his maker, as the Christians would say.

220
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,0000
Why should I care about what he did? Why he did it?

221
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,0000
He did it. That's the only thing that matters. Why he did it?

222
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,0000
No, I didn't mean to dwell into his psychology, but was not...

223
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,0000
He did.

224
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:19,0000
No, what I meant is, was there pressure from some Greek banking circles?

225
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,0000
Of course there was pressure. I had pressure.

226
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,0000
Can you imagine the pressure? The pressure was unbelievable.

227
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:31,0000
Threats to our family, pressure galore.

228
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:37,0000
But why were we elected? We were elected knowing that that pressure would be there.

229
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,0000
It's like saying, you know, you go to war and suddenly you're scared.

230
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,0000
Of course you're scared. It's war.

231
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:47,0000
If you're not scared, if you don't want to be scared, don't go to war.

232
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:52,0000
You get elected to be Prime Minister on the basis that you're proposing the escape,

233
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,0000
the mass escape from the debtors' prison.

234
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:02,0000
Deal with your fear. Don't succumb to it and do not surrender.

235
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:15,0000
Just another sub-question concerning all this debt stuff and so on.

236
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:21,0000
Or maybe we should... I'm not sure how far we should go here.

237
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:29,0000
Okay. Let's stop with this line and go to the next point.

238
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:34,0000
Big question, which is because I don't want to get lost in this.

239
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:40,0000
It is all these affairs of Greece and so on.

240
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:49,0000
What attracted me to you, what I liked, I remember meeting you in those years, was that...

241
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,0000
Okay, first nonetheless the sub-question.

242
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:59,0000
Didn't you write in your book that with that half-pornographic title, only for the adults or whatever,

243
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:07,0000
didn't you write in that book that when you threatened Schäuble, I think, we will do Grexit,

244
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,0000
that he basically told you, okay, do it, we give you 30 billion.

245
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,0000
No, no, no. Tsipras said that. I never said that.

246
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,0000
Ah, sorry. I thought it was you. My mistake.

247
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:20,0000
No, that's Tsipras' excuse. That when we threatened him with Grexit, it was his wish.

248
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:27,0000
That's just a big, huge, fat lie. We never threatened with Grexit.

249
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:32,0000
I knew that Schäuble wanted Grexit.

250
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:41,0000
Remember, my strategy was always to exploit the ruptures and the contradictions within the system.

251
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,0000
Yeah, of course.

252
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:48,0000
Okay. So one was the clash between the European Central Bank and the Buddhist Bank.

253
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:55,0000
The other one, major one, was the clash between the Chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the Finance Minister, Valtan Schäuble.

254
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,0000
They were not on the same...

255
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:05,0000
Oh, it was the mightiest of clashes. It was worse than the clash between Greece and the Troika.

256
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,0000
The clash between Schäuble and Merkel. You should hear him speak about her.

257
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,0000
Privately, do you?

258
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:18,0000
I'm not going to delve into it. But it was a clear difference of opinion.

259
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:23,0000
Merkel and Draghi wanted to keep Greece in a debtor's prison.

260
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:28,0000
Schäuble wanted to keep Greece out in order to send the signal to Paris.

261
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:33,0000
This is what you get if you want to use the Deutschmark, the euro, same thing, right?

262
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,0000
And you don't do as you're told.

263
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:41,0000
It was really a very clear difference of opinion.

264
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:48,0000
Schäuble was the one who proposed to me Grexit. I never threatened him with Grexit.

265
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:53,0000
All I said was, "I'm not taking another credit card from you, mate."

266
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:57,0000
Because we were bankrupt since 2010.

267
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:03,0000
And the crime against logic that was being imposed upon Greece by the Troika was...

268
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,0000
...they forced us to pretend we're not bankrupt.

269
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:12,0000
And the only way you can force somebody to pretend they're not bankrupt is by forcing them to borrow more money.

270
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:19,0000
And under conditions of austerity that shrinks your income, which was not enough to pay the previous debts, let alone the new debts.

271
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,0000
So I was saying to him, "I'm not signing."

272
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:29,0000
Imagine you owe money to the bank. You can't repay because your income has come down.

273
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:36,0000
And you go to the bank and say, "Let's restructure my debt, reduce the amount of debt so I can pay it."

274
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,0000
Because if you ask me to pay it, I'll go bankrupt and you'll get nothing.

275
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,0000
This is what bankers do every day.

276
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:52,0000
Imagine if the bank were to say, "I'm going to give you another credit card from which you're going to draw money with an interest, a heft interest, to repay the previous credit cards."

277
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:57,0000
But the condition for giving you that new credit card is that you will shrink your income.

278
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:01,0000
You would look at the bank and say, "Yeah, I haven't gone completely nuts."

279
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:05,0000
As if I'm going to say that. As if I'm going to say yes to that.

280
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:15,0000
So my line to Schauble was, "I'm not taking another credit card, pretending I'm going to pay you back on condition of destroying what is left of my people."

281
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:19,0000
And his argument was, "Okay, you're right. This doesn't work."

282
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:25,0000
He confessed that what he was proposing to us, what the troika was pushing down our throat, would never work.

283
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,0000
Lagarda confessed that to me too.

284
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:35,0000
Her argument was, "Yes, you're right, but you have to do what you're told, because otherwise you could build as a politician who's going to suffer."

285
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:42,0000
I thought, "Who gives a shit what my credibility as a politician suffers or doesn't suffer?"

286
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:52,0000
So when Schauble says to me, "It doesn't work," I said, "Okay, so why are you pushing it down my throat? If it doesn't work and we agree on that, what works?"

287
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,0000
And he said, "Get out of the euro."

288
00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:01,0000
And at that point, I exploited and I think effectively the clash between Merkel and Schauble.

289
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:13,0000
The moment he said to me, and that's in my book, the moment he said to me, "Get out of the euro," I said, "Wolfgang, you're a great believer in democratic legitimacy."

290
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,0000
He kept on talking about the importance of legitimacy.

291
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:21,0000
I said, "Do you have a mandate from your chancellor to say this to me?"

292
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,0000
He said, "No, not yet." I said, "Hang on a second."

293
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:29,0000
I take my phone out and I call Tsipras in front of him, put it on speakerphone.

294
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:36,0000
I said, "Wolfgang just said to me that he proposed that we get out of the euro and that a large part of the debt is written off, of course.

295
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:47,0000
If you don't have euros, you don't pay in euros. You pay in souvlaki or pistachios or something."

296
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:52,0000
"I've got a question for you, Alexei. Do you authorize me to have this discussion with him?"

297
00:24:52,000 --> 00:25:00,0000
And he said, "Yes, okay, but not that we are accepting it, just authorize to find out what he's offering."

298
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,0000
In front of him. Put the phone down. Your turn.

299
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:09,0000
He said, "I'm not going to speak to her now, I'm going to speak to her tomorrow, I'll call you back."

300
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:13,0000
We talked again a couple of days later. So what happened?

301
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:18,0000
He said, "Look, I fear that if I tell her she's not going to give the okay."

302
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:24,0000
So I was playing that game and in the end he never got the okay to discuss this with me.

303
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:37,0000
But you see, so Grexit was never their strategy. It was Schäuble's strategy and Merkel always vetoed it.

304
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:47,0000
In the end, to cut a long story short, I think that on the balance of probabilities,

305
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:52,0000
and this is a delicious paradox, one of those that you love,

306
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:58,0000
if we were prepared to get out of the euro, we wouldn't have to get out of the euro.

307
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:04,0000
If we were prepared to see it all the way to the end of the line,

308
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,0000
because the threat was we'll throw you out, we'll shut your banks and then you'll have to create your own currency.

309
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:15,0000
If we said yes, as I was ready to do, I'm going to do it. I'm going to issue my own currency, whatever the cost.

310
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,0000
Freedom has no price. We will do it.

311
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:24,0000
If we were prepared to do it, they would come to us at the eleventh hour begging us not to do it

312
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,0000
and we would have the dead haircut that we needed.

313
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,0000
So that was the plan. That's what I wanted to hear.

314
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,0000
That was the plan, yeah.

315
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,0000
But at the same time it was not bluffing because people said to me, "Oh, this is poker."

316
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:43,0000
No, it's not poker. Because to bluff in cards, it means to pretend that you have a power that you don't have.

317
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:48,0000
I was not pretending. I was going to take it all the way to the end with a drachma.

318
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:53,0000
So I had what in game theory we call a dominant strategy.

319
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:58,0000
A dominant strategy is one that you should follow, or you should want to follow,

320
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,0000
independently of what the other side does.

321
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:05,0000
That's not bluffing. It's the definition of not bluffing.

322
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:10,0000
Okay. I would like to go on indefinitely here.

323
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:15,0000
Because there's no public intellectual discussion so far.

324
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:22,0000
But for this, when people, that's to say me, take power, you get two years in Gulag.

325
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,0000
But that's another story. Seriously.

326
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:35,0000
So you think, if I may quote the immortal comrade Stalin, that in the choice Merkel versus Scheuble, which was worse, they were both worse?

327
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,0000
Or is there...

328
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,0000
I prefer Scheuble anytime.

329
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,0000
That's good to know. Yes, me also.

330
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:47,0000
Because you see, if he was chancellor, he and I would have an agreement.

331
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,0000
We would get out of the euro.

332
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:55,0000
We would not end up in that prison, in the death of prison forever.

333
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,0000
Or we wouldn't get out of the euro.

334
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:05,0000
The one thing we agreed on, because it was a really dramatic moment, it's captured in the movie by Costa Gavre's of Adults in the Room.

335
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,0000
I've tried to capture it.

336
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,0000
Who plays you, Brad Pitt or who?

337
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,0000
A Greek guy.

338
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,0000
Because Costa Gavre's, it was going to be Ray Fiennes, by the way.

339
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,0000
Sorry?

340
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:22,0000
It was going to be Ray Fiennes, but then Costa Gavre's decided that he wants realism, which is a very bad idea in art.

341
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,0000
Very bad idea.

342
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,0000
Very bad idea.

343
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:30,0000
Realism meant that when my character spoke to the Tsipras character, we should be speaking fluent Greek.

344
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,0000
And when I would speak to them, I would be in English.

345
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,0000
So no non-Greek actor could ever do that.

346
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:49,0000
So, but yeah, there was this moment when, I believe it was June 2015, I was in the Finance Ministry in Berlin.

347
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,0000
By the way, you know what that building is?

348
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,0000
Sorry?

349
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,0000
Do you know what the building of the Ministry of Finance is?

350
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,0000
Yes, yes.

351
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,0000
What is it?

352
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,0000
No.

353
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,0000
You don't know.

354
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,0000
It's Gehring's headquarters.

355
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,0000
That's what I know, but I don't know where it is, but this I knew.

356
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,0000
It's the same building.

357
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:12,0000
It's mind-numbingly toxic to get into that building.

358
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,0000
You can feel the aura.

359
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,0000
And it's ugly.

360
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,0000
A sin.

361
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,0000
Anyway.

362
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,0000
Is sin ugly for you?

363
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,0000
Well, this is my Anglo-Saxon upbringing, right?

364
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,0000
I didn't mean it.

365
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,0000
Sin is wonderful.

366
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:35,0000
Okay, so he was pushing me, pushing me, pushing me to sign, and I kept saying no, no, no.

367
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,0000
And at some point I said, he was becoming very assertive.

368
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:44,0000
And I said, look, Wolfgang, I'm not going to sign, but I would like to ask you for a favor.

369
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,0000
You've been in this business for 40 years in politics.

370
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,0000
I've been in this business for four months.

371
00:29:50,000 --> 00:30:01,0000
Can we pretend for 10 minutes that we're not ministers so that you can give me your advice not to order me what to do?

372
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,0000
He said, okay.

373
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:08,0000
Very sort of in a friendly manner.

374
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,0000
And he was quite magnanimous at that moment.

375
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,0000
And I said, okay, we're not ministers now.

376
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:19,0000
Tell me, if you were me, would you sign?

377
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:28,0000
And to my astonishment, he looked outside the window for a while.

378
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,0000
You know, it's nerve-racking.

379
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:35,0000
And then he looked at me, and at that moment I actually liked the man.

380
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:42,0000
He said, as a patriot, no.

381
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,0000
And then I said, so why are you forcing me to do it?

382
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,0000
He says, don't you understand?

383
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,0000
What am I going to do with Paris?

384
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:56,0000
They want to have the Deutsche Mark, and they want to run their own national budget.

385
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,0000
You can't have both.

386
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:03,0000
So every time you use the euro, remember it's the Deutsche Mark.

387
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,0000
Don't mistake it for a European currency.

388
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,0000
Okay.

389
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:13,0000
I'm so sorry we could go endlessly in this way, but let's go to the next big -- just one remark which you will like.

390
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:21,0000
Remember that when we first met around that time, I was immediately attracted by why you told me.

391
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:28,0000
You told me, and you repeated it now, but not as brutally as I will say now, that your message to Schäuble and so on was,

392
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:34,0000
what I'm bringing to you is the most rational way to get some of your money back.

393
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,0000
You are not playing this sentimental violin, we are poor people.

394
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,0000
No.

395
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,0000
No, never.

396
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:44,0000
You are bringing some money back. You are honest.

397
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:49,0000
You know, you heard of Amartya Sen, the economist, the Indian economist, nice guy.

398
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,0000
Really?

399
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,0000
Very clever guy.

400
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:55,0000
I have problems with Indians, but that's my racism, okay?

401
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,0000
He's a smart man.

402
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:04,0000
I met him in London after the end of this period when I had resigned.

403
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,0000
And he said, you know, Yanis, what your problem was?

404
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,0000
He had gotten it.

405
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:13,0000
You were negotiating with creditors who did not want their money back.

406
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,0000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

407
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,0000
They didn't want their money back.

408
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:22,0000
They wanted to crash us, in which case we should simply have agreed to get out of Europe.

409
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:31,0000
But you know, at the same time, Merkel, who was above that, she had a good concept of what was at stake

410
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:40,0000
because she had German manufacturers, Volkswagen, Siemens and so on, holding her to not letting the Euro crash

411
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:46,0000
because the last thing that they wanted was the recreation of the Italian national currency, the lira.

412
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,0000
Because they hated the lira before 2000.

413
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,0000
Why?

414
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:55,0000
Because every time Volkswagen became slightly more competitive than the equivalent Fiat,

415
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:59,0000
the Italian central bank would devalue the lira and make it cheaper.

416
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,0000
And German industrialists hated that.

417
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:13,0000
So, you know, Merkel had them in mind, whereas Scheuble had a more hegemonic power game in his mind.

418
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,0000
OK.

419
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:23,0000
Now, you already approached the second question where I'm even more, if this is possible, on your side,

420
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:30,0000
it's already clear with this wonderful paradoxical formula that you proposed, that you have a creditor

421
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,0000
who does not want you to repay the debt.

422
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:41,0000
Isn't it, we talked about this often, one of the features of, I don't know how to call it,

423
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:51,0000
new face in the world order where, as you told me, we no longer live in this traditional neoliberal

424
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,0000
market order and so on and so on.

425
00:33:54,000 --> 00:34:05,0000
You remember, we were talking even on phone, you remember that moment, I think it was in the spring or summer of 2020,

426
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:13,0000
when on almost the same day that the numbers came out from United Kingdom and United States

427
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:19,0000
of how the production fell down, stock market went up.

428
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:25,0000
And then you say there is something tremendous happening now in capitalism.

429
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:30,0000
It's no longer the old market, profit, productivity and so on.

430
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,0000
It's no longer capitalism.

431
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,0000
Can you develop this?

432
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,0000
Yeah.

433
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,0000
I'll go back to that date.

434
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,0000
Thank you for reminding me.

435
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:45,0000
It was the 12th of August, 2020, not the last August, the previous one.

436
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:53,0000
Nine o'clock in the morning in London, the news came out that the national income of Britain, GDP as it's called,

437
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,0000
had fallen by more than 20%.

438
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,0000
That has never happened before in the history of capitalism.

439
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,0000
British GDP falling in one year by 21% or so.

440
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,0000
Never.

441
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,0000
It was not anticipated.

442
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:11,0000
The markets were expecting a fall of 8%, 9%, 10%, 20%.

443
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,0000
No one.

444
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,0000
No one.

445
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:26,0000
15 or 16 minutes later, the stock exchange, the London stock exchange goes up by 3%.

446
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,0000
There can be no explanation of that along the lines of capitalism.

447
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,0000
Right?

448
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:40,0000
One explanation would have been if the markets were already factoring in, expecting a 10% decline

449
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:48,0000
and it was 8%, things were better than expected, so the stock exchange might have gone up.

450
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:54,0000
But to expect 10% and to have 20% and the stock exchange to go up, something else was going on.

451
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,0000
I know what it is.

452
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,0000
I'll tell you what it is.

453
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:04,0000
Since 2008, the great financial crash, capitalism is on a drip feed.

454
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:10,0000
It's being kept alive through constant injections of money from the central banks.

455
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,0000
That has never happened before.

456
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,0000
It started in 2008.

457
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,0000
In 1929, it didn't happen.

458
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:22,0000
That's why all the banks closed down.

459
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:29,0000
So the banking system and the stock exchange had 12 years of getting used to, becoming addicted to,

460
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:35,0000
central bank money being pumped their way during difficult moments.

461
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:39,0000
So imagine you're a stock broker in London.

462
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:43,0000
You hear the news at 9 o'clock in the morning, minus 20%.

463
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,0000
Oh my God!

464
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,0000
You think that's the first thought.

465
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:52,0000
Then you think, ah, if I panicked, the guys and girls in the Bank of England, the central bank of England, are panicking.

466
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,0000
So what they're going to do is they're going to print even more billions

467
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:59,0000
and they will give it to me to play in the stock exchange.

468
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,0000
Bye.

469
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:09,0000
So the point I've been developing in my head, and we had a little discussion about this earlier

470
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:13,0000
because I was telling Slavoj that this will be my next book next year,

471
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:19,0000
it's my crazy theory that capitalism has already evolved out of itself.

472
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:23,0000
It has been transformed into another system.

473
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:28,0000
And the reason why I say that is because for me capitalism requires two things.

474
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,0000
Firstly, profit to drive it.

475
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,0000
It's like a petrol engine that needs petrol.

476
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:40,0000
Capitalism needs profit, private profit to drive it, capital accumulation as we Marxists used to say.

477
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:44,0000
And the other thing is that exploitation takes place in markets.

478
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,0000
That's the whole point about capitalism.

479
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:51,0000
In feudalism, there was no market exploitation.

480
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:58,0000
You had the peasants, they were growing rubbish, wheat and potatoes and cauliflower,

481
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,0000
I don't know what it is, that they were growing,

482
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:05,0000
and then the sheriff on behalf of the Lord would come and take half of it, or 60% of it.

483
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:10,0000
There was no market, it was just expropriation.

484
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:18,0000
It is with the enclosures and the eviction of the peasants who then become suppliers of labor at any price

485
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:24,0000
so that you have the creation of the working class and the labor market, because there was no labor market before that.

486
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,0000
So exploitation takes place through markets.

487
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:32,0000
Money markets, land markets, house markets, labor markets.

488
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:38,0000
But now, after 12 years of the 2008 crisis and beyond,

489
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:44,0000
we have the replacement of profit by central bank money,

490
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:48,0000
that is the new fuel of the system, of this exploitative system,

491
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:56,0000
and the steady encroachment into the space of markets of platforms.

492
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:00,0000
Amazon. The moment you go into Amazon, or Facebook,

493
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,0000
the moment you enter Facebook, you're outside of capitalism, you're not in capitalism anymore.

494
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,0000
Because, explain.

495
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,0000
You go into Facebook, right?

496
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:14,0000
Let's say you want to sell your stuff, to advertise your business in Facebook.

497
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:19,0000
You go in, you use your credit card, you pay money to Zuckerberg,

498
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:24,0000
and some more people see your advertisements, right?

499
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,0000
You go in there to meet your friends.

500
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:32,0000
You want to advertise this evening.

501
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,0000
You go and pay money.

502
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:36,0000
One person owns the whole digital space.

503
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,0000
It is the equivalent of stepping outside in Ljubljana.

504
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,0000
Imagine, yeah, just science fiction for a moment.

505
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:45,0000
Imagine you step out in Ljubljana, on the streets of Ljubljana tonight,

506
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:50,0000
and you look around and you think, "Oh my God, all these buildings belong to one person."

507
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:56,0000
Everything that is traded in the shops that I see is controlled by one person,

508
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:00,0000
who decides what prices are charged, what prices are not charged,

509
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,0000
who can trade, who can't trade, who can buy, who can't buy.

510
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:09,0000
And moreover, imagine that Ljubljana operated like Facebook does or Amazon does,

511
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:17,0000
whereby what your eyes see is determined by one person, by the algorithm of one person,

512
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:21,0000
who if he wants you not to see something, you will never see it in that digital space.

513
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:25,0000
This is not a market. This is a fief, a fiefdom.

514
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,0000
It's a digital fiefdom. It's a platform.

515
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,0000
Those platforms make a lot of money.

516
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:34,0000
But the rest of the economy, look at companies like Uber, for instance.

517
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,0000
They've never made a profit, ever.

518
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:40,0000
You have private equity. Have you heard of private equity?

519
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,0000
Do you know what private equity does?

520
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:48,0000
They go and they buy a company, let's say a company that provides health services.

521
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,0000
It's got doctors and nurses and stuff, private stuff.

522
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:55,0000
So they buy the hospital, they buy the company, and then they create two companies.

523
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:59,0000
One that owns the buildings and all the fixed assets,

524
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:02,0000
and the other that provides the services.

525
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,0000
And the second company sells the services to the first company.

526
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,0000
The first company has assets, buildings.

527
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:15,0000
So they go to the bank and they get a huge loan using as collateral the buildings of the first company.

528
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,0000
They take this money and they give it to themselves.

529
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:20,0000
They pay themselves. They give it to the shareholders.

530
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,0000
They pocket it. They put it in their money.

531
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,0000
Now, this whole company will never have a profit,

532
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:28,0000
because the second company will owe a huge quantity of money to the first company,

533
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,0000
and therefore they will never pay any tax,

534
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,0000
because if you have no profits, there is no tax.

535
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:36,0000
But the whole point about profitability is coming out.

536
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:41,0000
Very soon after that, this is an empty shell. This will go bankrupt. It will die.

537
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:45,0000
So platforms are expanding, even in health.

538
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:51,0000
Facebook is now privatizing the National Health Service in Britain without anybody knowing.

539
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,0000
Google is doing the same thing behind the scenes.

540
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:57,0000
By the way, DM25, our movement, is beginning a campaign on Monday in Britain

541
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:04,0000
against the surreptitious privatization of the NHS by Big Tech.

542
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,0000
Close brackets.

543
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:11,0000
So you see, platforms are expanding. They are not markets, and markets are shrinking.

544
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:15,0000
And central bank money, sovereign money, that defends money,

545
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,0000
because they are defending the governments.

546
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:22,0000
They have no power, but their printing presses are keeping the system alive.

547
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,0000
I call this techno-fiddleism.

548
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:30,0000
And it's not just a question of curiosity about how the system works.

549
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:34,0000
It's also a question of what does this mean for daily lives?

550
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,0000
What does it mean for all of us?

551
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,0000
What does it mean for governments?

552
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,0000
I'll tell you what it means as an economist for a start.

553
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:44,0000
It means that none of the fiscal monetary policies that used to work, work.

554
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:50,0000
Because when platforms replace markets, and everything depends on the central bank money,

555
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:54,0000
if I make you the head of the European Central Bank tomorrow,

556
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:58,0000
you are the most slavish follower of the needs of business.

557
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,0000
You have no independence. You have no authority.

558
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:06,0000
Even if you want to reduce the amount of money, euros, that the ECB prints,

559
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,0000
you can't do it. The moment you do it, the whole thing will collapse.

560
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:14,0000
That's not central bank independence. That's dependence.

561
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:26,0000
It means that our governments are completely in the clasps of the interests of these large fiefdoms.

562
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:34,0000
And they have tiny degrees of freedom regarding fiscal policy, regarding redistribution of wealth,

563
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:41,0000
when all the wealth is encased and enclosed in the new fiefdoms.

564
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:48,0000
But also, and here is something that would be nice to talk a little bit more about,

565
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,0000
look, understand the capitalism.

566
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:57,0000
You have a working class which is exploited during the working time,

567
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:01,0000
and then they go home, and that's time for themselves.

568
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:06,0000
Today you have a proletariat, a working class, which is shrinking, shrinking, shrinking,

569
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:13,0000
and increasingly everybody is producing capital directly for these fiefdoms.

570
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:18,0000
Every time you have your phone and you walk around, Google knows where you are,

571
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:22,0000
and that enriches the software of Google Maps.

572
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:26,0000
It adds your movements, add capital to Google.

573
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:32,0000
You're not a shareholder. You don't get shares for that capital. They get it.

574
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:38,0000
With the pandemic, we've seen how work and leisure have been completely decoupled,

575
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:46,0000
and how with these digital fiefdoms technologies, it is impossible to even escape for a moment

576
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:52,0000
the vestiges of work. It follows you.

577
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:58,0000
Your boss expects you to be checking your app at midnight.

578
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:02,0000
You yourself check your app, even if your boss doesn't want you to check your app.

579
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,0000
You become self-enslaved.

580
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:12,0000
And the most important value of liberalism, which is personal sovereignty, goes.

581
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:16,0000
Think of the youngsters. I used to be a professor up until a few years ago.

582
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,0000
I still am in name.

583
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:28,0000
I look at today's youth, and what I find is young people lacking the sovereignty

584
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:31,0000
that the liberal democratic system has promised them.

585
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:40,0000
I see them, for instance, take on courses that they know are rubbish, just to add to the CV.

586
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:48,0000
I see them constantly trying to improve their social ratings in Twitter, in Instagram,

587
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,0000
because they're selling themselves constantly.

588
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:56,0000
They are creating a profile that makes them, because they know that the moment they go in for an interview,

589
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:03,0000
that the interviewing panel is going to check their social media profile.

590
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:16,0000
So it's a constant struggle to build up a profile along the lines of the expectations of some fictitious future employer.

591
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:25,0000
That is slavery, the complete collapse of the private space that liberals value so much.

592
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:32,0000
These are the reasons why, for me, techno-fiddleism is such a menace.

593
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:41,0000
The worst part of it is that when I speak of this, do you know who really loads my thesis more than anybody else?

594
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,0000
The left.

595
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:52,0000
Because we leftists grew up with this ambition that we would bring capitalism down.

596
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:57,0000
And here I am telling them that, you know what, we are out of time.

597
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:02,0000
Capitalism has brought itself down and it's been replaced by something far worse, not by socialism.

598
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,0000
The left does not want to listen to that.

599
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:10,0000
They really loathe that message.

600
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:14,0000
Perfect. Now we are going in the right direction.

601
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:18,0000
A sub-question.

602
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,0000
A sub-question.

603
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:24,0000
I know there are many answers to this, but you are, for me, for the time being still,

604
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:27,0000
some kind of subject supposed to know.

605
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:32,0000
So one of the enigmas, from a very superficial standpoint,

606
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:35,0000
I know there are many explanations, I want to hear yours,

607
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:42,0000
is with all this money thrown into, why is there no inflation?

608
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:46,0000
Do you think now there are only lately some fears of inflation?

609
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:49,0000
What's your answer to the inflation problem?

610
00:47:49,000 --> 00:48:01,0000
Okay. Between 2008 and the pandemic, we had the constant manufacture of mountain ranges of money

611
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,0000
that was thrown into the economy.

612
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:06,0000
The traditional monetarist right-wing economists were saying,

613
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,0000
"Oh, this is going to create inflation."

614
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:11,0000
No. Zero inflation.

615
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:14,0000
The central banks were struggling to create inflation.

616
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,0000
They couldn't. They were pumping money into the economy, hoping prices would go up.

617
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:21,0000
They wouldn't. Prices would be stagnant or falling.

618
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,0000
Why was that the case?

619
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:28,0000
Well, while wealth was going up. Wealth of very, very few.

620
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:34,0000
Because think about it. 2008 was our 1929, complete collapse of the financial sector,

621
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:41,0000
immediately a recession, very low investment, very low demand,

622
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:46,0000
low quality jobs, as David Graeber called them, "bullshit jobs."

623
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:50,0000
Okay. So that was the scene since 2008.

624
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:53,0000
The central bank prints money.

625
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:57,0000
What is the theory of quantitative easing, as it's called, money printing?

626
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:03,0000
Up until 2008, the idea was that if you want to stimulate the economy through the central bank,

627
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,0000
you reduce interest rates.

628
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:07,0000
Well, you can't reduce them when they are zero.

629
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:10,0000
I mean, you can. You can take them to zero minus 0.5.

630
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:15,0000
But if you take them to minus 3 percent, would you keep money in the bank if you lost 3 percent?

631
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:19,0000
Every month. So the banking system would be destroyed.

632
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:26,0000
So they reached the lower zero bound, and then they had to do something to stimulate further.

633
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,0000
So they started printing money.

634
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:35,0000
But the thing is, in capitalism, as we had it in the last 100 years,

635
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:40,0000
since the creation of the Fed, the central bank of the United States and so on,

636
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:45,0000
the legal structure is this. You have a central bank.

637
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,0000
The central bank is not like other banks.

638
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:52,0000
You and I cannot have accounts with the central bank, but the banks have an account with the central bank.

639
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:55,0000
So all the commercial banks have an account with the central bank.

640
00:49:55,000 --> 00:50:00,0000
The central bank, if it wants to create money, it effectively gives an overdraft facility.

641
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:05,0000
It types numbers, you know, a few billion into the accounts of the commercial banks,

642
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:08,0000
hoping that the commercial banks will get that money.

643
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:15,0000
It's free money. To lend it to businesses who are then going to take it and invest it.

644
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:21,0000
You know, hire people, invest in machinery, education, training and so on.

645
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:24,0000
Right? That's the theory. What's the reality?

646
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,0000
The reality, and I have witnessed that, I have to tell you.

647
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:30,0000
The reality is this. Take the European Central Bank.

648
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:35,0000
I could take the Fed or any other, but we are in the Eurozone, so I'll take the European Central Bank.

649
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:41,0000
The European Central Bank, somebody from the office, the staff, calls up Deutsche Bank.

650
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:45,0000
Says, "I've got a couple of trillion euros.

651
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:49,0000
I will give it to you at minus 0.5 interest rate."

652
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:52,0000
You know what that means. "I will pay you to take it.

653
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:55,0000
I will pay you 0.5% to take it."

654
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:58,0000
I mean, who in their right mind says no?

655
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:02,0000
Imagine if I were to say that I'm going to pay you to take money off my hands.

656
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,0000
So Deutsche Bank says, "Give it to me."

657
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:09,0000
Now, Deutsche Bank looks at all the people out there who suffer austerity,

658
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:14,0000
who have bullshit jobs, and says, "Yeah, as if I'm going to lend it to them.

659
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:17,0000
I will never get it back."

660
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,0000
So you know what Deutsche Bank does?

661
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:22,0000
Picks up the phone and calls Volkswagen.

662
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:26,0000
Siemens, Alstom, Google, Apple.

663
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:29,0000
And say, "Would you like some free money?

664
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:33,0000
I've got a few billion here. I'll give it to you for free. Zero."

665
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,0000
Deutsche Bank has already made a profit.

666
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:38,0000
It's been paid for by the central bank to take it,

667
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:42,0000
and it's giving it away for free.

668
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:47,0000
You know, it's a very easy life for those people.

669
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:51,0000
Volkswagen, by the way, Google.

670
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:57,0000
Apple has 210 billion dollars of savings.

671
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:00,0000
Just stating that, you know there's something really wrong with capitalism,

672
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:03,0000
because companies should never save.

673
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:06,0000
You and I should save, and companies should borrow it from us to invest.

674
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:09,0000
When the companies have billions of savings, there's something wrong.

675
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,0000
Close bracket again.

676
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:15,0000
But nevertheless, you know, Volkswagen has billions in the bank,

677
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,0000
which is not investing. It's too fearful.

678
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:18,0000
Why is Volkswagen not investing?

679
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:21,0000
They could have created a Tesla competitor,

680
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:26,0000
but they look at you folks and say, "Yes, if they will be able to buy it."

681
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:31,0000
They're useless, poor folks. They can't afford to pay 100,000 euros

682
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:34,0000
for a top-of-the-range Tesla competitor.

683
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:37,0000
So instead, they do something simpler.

684
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:41,0000
They take the money from Deutsche Bank, and they go to the Frankfurt Stock Exchange.

685
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,0000
And you know what they do?

686
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:45,0000
They buy Volkswagen shares.

687
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:48,0000
Volkswagen buys Volkswagen shares.

688
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:52,0000
Guess what happens to the share price? It goes up.

689
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:58,0000
Their own salaries, the Volkswagen directors, are linked to the share price.

690
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:03,0000
So they get money out of that, personal money, not as a company.

691
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:07,0000
And they go to Berlin and they buy a nice apartment.

692
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,0000
House prices go up.

693
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:12,0000
So if you have apartments in Berlin, you benefit from that.

694
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:18,0000
So there is a lot of asset price inflation,

695
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:21,0000
but the little people out there don't have money to buy anything,

696
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,0000
so there's no price inflation.

697
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,0000
So that was the situation about it now.

698
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:32,0000
Now things are getting slightly demented and different.

699
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:35,0000
What happened was COVID-19.

700
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:41,0000
During this period of globalization, of the neoliberal story,

701
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:44,0000
not the reality of the story,

702
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:50,0000
whereas once upon a time you had a car that was being made into plants.

703
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:55,0000
There was a plant here making engines and another one making the chassis and the car.

704
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,0000
And then they would bring them together.

705
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:00,0000
In the last 30 years, I was reading about that,

706
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:10,0000
a Nissan Qashqai made in Newcastle in North England was made in 120 different places.

707
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:20,0000
And the fender, the protective piece of plastic at the front,

708
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:28,0000
crisscrossed between Britain and the continent 35 times before it was completed.

709
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:31,0000
First it would go as metal, then they would do something, then it would go back,

710
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,0000
then it would put some lights on, then it would go back.

711
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:39,0000
So this is what I mean by supply chains, lots of transporting.

712
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:48,0000
And a supply network that was working like a Swiss watch, beautifully.

713
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:52,0000
Everything measured at the last moment, just in moment,

714
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:56,0000
no warehouses to save on money.

715
00:54:56,000 --> 00:55:00,0000
So it would be a system that worked like clockwork.

716
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:05,0000
You would need a shock absorber and suddenly the shock absorber would arrive in the truck.

717
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,0000
You wouldn't have to store it anywhere.

718
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:12,0000
But the moment COVID-19 hit and the governments pressed the stop button,

719
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:15,0000
all those factories stopped working.

720
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:23,0000
Now the ships that were, the container ships that were carrying stuff from China to Los Angeles,

721
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:30,0000
industrial goods, iPhones, whatever, they were in mid-journey.

722
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,0000
They were in the middle of the Pacific.

723
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,0000
They couldn't stop.

724
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,0000
So they went to Los Angeles.

725
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,0000
They all accumulated in Los Angeles.

726
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,0000
They got there.

727
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,0000
The ports were not working.

728
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,0000
Nothing was working.

729
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,0000
They got stuck there.

730
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:54,0000
Similarly, the tankers carrying LNG, liquid gas, from Qatar to China,

731
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:58,0000
continued and ended up in China, unloaded the LNG.

732
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:01,0000
Stayed there.

733
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:04,0000
Then when they pressed the green button again for the whole system to work again,

734
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,0000
it couldn't work.

735
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,0000
Why?

736
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:10,0000
Because all the ships that should carry stuff that was being produced in China

737
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,0000
were all in Los Angeles.

738
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:16,0000
And all the ships that were carrying energy from Qatar to China were in China.

739
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:20,0000
Now you may say that, "Okay, well, how long does it take for those ships to go back?

740
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,0000
It takes a month."

741
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:24,0000
Yeah, it takes a month, but it doesn't solve the problem because by the time they are back,

742
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,0000
the stockpiles are huge.

743
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:31,0000
Meanwhile, COVID-19 meant that consumer demand for goods went up

744
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:34,0000
because we were all stuck inside the house and we were all doing stupid things

745
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,0000
to pass the time with.

746
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,0000
Right?

747
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:42,0000
So demand went up, stockpiles went up, and the supply chains broke down.

748
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,0000
That pushed energy prices up.

749
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:47,0000
That pushed transport prices.

750
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:53,0000
Now, there is another element here which you won't hear many people telling me this,

751
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:58,0000
but that's why it's important that I should let you into the secret.

752
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:02,0000
Capitalism works on the basis of futures markets.

753
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:09,0000
The great money, the great profits are not made so much in buying and selling stuff,

754
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:13,0000
but in buying and selling the right to buy and sell stuff.

755
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:14,0000
Right?

756
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:22,0000
So people go to the Chicago exchange and they buy next year's oranges,

757
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:25,0000
oranges that doesn't exist, which will exist next year.

758
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,0000
They can do the same thing with transport.

759
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:32,0000
They can buy transport capacity now for the next 10 years.

760
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:39,0000
So speculators who saw, who predicted that the transport costs for a container would go up

761
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:43,0000
because of this, of what I just described,

762
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:52,0000
they went in and bought the transport capacity of 80% of shipping all at once.

763
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:59,0000
And their game now is to starve the market of transport capacity in order to push the price up further.

764
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:10,0000
So these futures capitalist markets are turbocharging the problem that COVID-19 created with supply chains.

765
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,0000
And similarly with energy.

766
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:15,0000
With energy you have other aspects too.

767
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:19,0000
You have Vladimir Putin, who is playing games with the European Union

768
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:26,0000
in order to force the European Union to force, to convince the European Union to give the green light

769
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:36,0000
to the Nord Stream 2 pipeline that bypasses Ukraine and going through down the Baltic Strait to Germany.

770
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:43,0000
He's reducing the supply of energy at a time when for some reason wind, I've been told,

771
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:50,0000
has died down in the last eight months compared to the average strength of the wind in the North Sea across Europe,

772
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:55,0000
which meant that wind power generation went down at a time when the supply of gas, because of...

773
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,0000
So there are...

774
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:01,0000
Okay, these things should iron themselves out very quickly.

775
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:11,0000
But when you throw in the speculation, it's much easier to see how these problems are magnified

776
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,0000
and stretched into the future.

777
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:23,0000
Now, with working classes, the precariat, the weaker members of society,

778
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:31,0000
having suffered 12, 30 years of this deflation while the rich are getting richer through the process of money printing

779
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:39,0000
by the central banks that I described, when these people are facing deflation, they have incredibly bad jobs.

780
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:47,0000
They are now facing increases in their rents, they're facing increases in their electricity bill and so on.

781
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:57,0000
You realize that their circumstances are becoming increasingly unbearable,

782
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:01,0000
even though for the last 12 years they were almost used to unbearable circumstances.

783
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:05,0000
This is now getting deeper and worse.

784
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:11,0000
And it's not to this, the terrible authoritarianism of states and governments that through COVID-19

785
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:15,0000
discovered that they can do anything they want with us.

786
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:21,0000
Because think about it, I mean, I'm not against lockdowns if you have a pandemic,

787
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:26,0000
but the power to say to people you're not going to stay part of your home is an exigent power.

788
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:35,0000
When you've had government after government after government serving the interests of the 1% of the 1%,

789
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:40,0000
naturally authoritarian, increasingly authoritarian with COVID-19,

790
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:51,0000
it is really very easy if you combine the discontent felt by rising prices, falling quality of jobs,

791
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:56,0000
not so much quantity, but bullshit jobs multiplying.

792
01:00:56,000 --> 01:01:01,0000
With fear of the system, with mistrust in the government, you bring all these things together,

793
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:06,0000
and this is a great gift for fascists.

794
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,0000
That's it.

795
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:11,0000
Okay, let's now do the next step.

796
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:20,0000
I agree with the dark image you painted of where we are.

797
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:26,0000
Okay, there is now a why the answer that I will give you now,

798
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:31,0000
and I don't believe in it, but I want from you a theoretical confirmation,

799
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:36,0000
because a naive old Marxist leftist would have said, "Perfect.

800
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:40,0000
With these neo-federal corporations, everything is already there.

801
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:45,0000
Centralized, we just boom, boom, nationalize it, and we are in happy."

802
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:49,0000
So why this doesn't work?

803
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:54,0000
Because it seems at some naive point the obvious thing to do.

804
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:59,0000
I said that to the good people of Google inside their den.

805
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,0000
They were very kind.

806
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:09,0000
A few years ago, they invited me to go to their campus in California to give a speech inside of Google.

807
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:12,0000
I entered Google and gave a speech.

808
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:17,0000
They asked me to speak about digital money, which of course they are very interested in.

809
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:20,0000
What I said to them was, "Well, not exactly that."

810
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:30,0000
I said, "The problem with you guys is that your search technology is so stupendously wonderful

811
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:36,0000
that you have invented the human right, the right to do a Google search.

812
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:39,0000
Because if you now, given that this is now available for everybody,

813
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:45,0000
if you deny you or you or you, if somebody, let's say the government,

814
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:51,0000
the world, extraterrestrials, deny you the right to use Google, they deny you a human right.

815
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:56,0000
It's so important to be able to search stuff on Google's search engine

816
01:02:56,000 --> 01:03:04,0000
that its denial is an abdication of a human right.

817
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:10,0000
So the problem, however, is that if you have invented the human right,

818
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:14,0000
if it is a human right, you have no right to own it.

819
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:17,0000
So you should all be nationalized.

820
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,0000
And?

821
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,0000
They looked at me.

822
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:27,0000
I said, "Just kidding." So I continued to the next one.

823
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:31,0000
Either they would have kicked me out or gotten a heart attack.

824
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:40,0000
So the problem, however, with nationalizing is that these are not national corporations.

825
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,0000
Google is not a national corporation.

826
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:46,0000
What nation, what state is going to nationalize Google?

827
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,0000
Even the United States cannot do it.

828
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,0000
They're everywhere.

829
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:54,0000
They're in every nook and cranny of the digital space of planet Earth.

830
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:57,0000
Facebook. How do you nationalize Facebook?

831
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:02,0000
You can internationalize it, but for that you need the world government.

832
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:07,0000
And the moment we start saying that, you know, I think half of the people in here will leave.

833
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:11,0000
All right?

834
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:23,0000
For me, the trick is to create a transnational movement that challenges the ownership of corporations.

835
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:36,0000
Since the 16th century, we have a monstrosity that is growing within the bosom of our societies.

836
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:40,0000
The idea of liquid ownership of shares.

837
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:43,0000
Think about it. We take it for granted.

838
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:48,0000
Okay? I could have a corner shop that makes bicycles.

839
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:52,0000
I can sell it to Slavoj. That makes some kind of sense.

840
01:04:52,000 --> 01:05:00,0000
But the idea that you have a large corporation and you take the ownership of that corporation

841
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:08,0000
and you slice it up in tiny little pieces called shares, which then trade anonymously,

842
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:18,0000
like confetti, like, you know, baseball cards in the United States.

843
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:29,0000
And decision making about what that company does is based on the General Assembly of the shareholders, who are anonymous.

844
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:35,0000
And the more of those pieces of paper you've bought, the more votes you have in the General Assembly.

845
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:43,0000
Now, if we didn't have capitalism, imagine this is the 16th century, and I were to propose this system to you,

846
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:47,0000
you would have thought I'm mad. And very rightly so.

847
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:51,0000
We know what happened with the first joint stock company.

848
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:56,0000
It was a British East India's company. 1599, London.

849
01:05:56,000 --> 01:06:03,0000
It was at the time when Hamlet was finishing, not Hamlet, Shakespeare was finishing Hamlet, not the other way around.

850
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:09,0000
Within 10 years, that company became bigger than the British state.

851
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:15,0000
They had 200,000 soldiers with which they expropriated India, Indonesia.

852
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:20,0000
They destroyed millions of people's lives.

853
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:24,0000
And this is the very basis of capitalism.

854
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:32,0000
The idea of as many votes as I can buy, depending on wealth.

855
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:41,0000
Because, you see, I mean, Jeff Bezos became, what, by $50 billion richer during the pandemic.

856
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:45,0000
He didn't do anything during the pandemic. He's a smart man.

857
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:48,0000
There's no doubt that Jeff Bezos is smarter than I am.

858
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:54,0000
He's far better entrepreneur than I am, that goes without saying.

859
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:58,0000
But the $50 billion that he made during the pandemic, he didn't work for.

860
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:08,0000
He was making it in his sleep. The wealth he had in the stock exchange was breeding more wealth.

861
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:18,0000
And by the way, in ancient Greek and in Greek, the word for interest is the same as the word for giving birth.

862
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:23,0000
Actually, labor, female labor.

863
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:29,0000
So I have a very simple alternative to taking over and nationalizing. Who's going to run Facebook?

864
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:34,0000
I mean, imagine if I made you managing director of Facebook.

865
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,0000
I mean, we would shut it down. It would stop functioning.

866
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:43,0000
Or me, for that matter. This is not taking shots, cheap shots at Slavoj.

867
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:48,0000
Imagine if we had a very simple change in corporate law,

868
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:56,0000
where we say that shares become like library cards in a university.

869
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:59,0000
You enroll in a university, you get a library card.

870
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:04,0000
It gives you privileges. You can take books out, you can connect to the internet, you can go into venues,

871
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:08,0000
you can vote in elections, student's union selections.

872
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:13,0000
You can't sell that card. You cannot hire it. You cannot lease it. You cannot buy it.

873
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:21,0000
There's no market for it. It is your right to have it, like a vote in the political arena.

874
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:32,0000
Right? You can have it, you can use it, but you can't sell it or buy it. At least not formally.

875
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,0000
Imagine how that would transform the world.

876
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:38,0000
Suddenly Facebook will belong only to people who work there.

877
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:44,0000
And imagine if at the same time you introduced another change in ownership rights,

878
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:50,0000
so that people own their own data and Facebook cannot touch it without paying you.

879
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:56,0000
The world is transformed. All of a sudden. Those large companies are going to shrink.

880
01:08:56,000 --> 01:09:00,0000
Why would they shrink? Because, you know, if you have a company with 800,000 workers,

881
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:05,0000
and they all have one share each, they can't run it. It's too many.

882
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:11,0000
The optimal size is what? At most 10,000 people.

883
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:15,0000
So they would themselves decide, you don't even need a state to come in a Stalinist way

884
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:18,0000
and take it over and break it down.

885
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:26,0000
This is why I put a lot of emphasis on, as Marx did, wishy-washy stuff about social justice and equality.

886
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:34,0000
That for me means nothing. It is simply bourgeois, claptrap for the purposes of massaging our conscience.

887
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:41,0000
You want to talk seriously about liberating people from the shackles in which they live.

888
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:47,0000
Change ownership rights. Change corporate law and make shares non-tradable.

889
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:51,0000
One person, one share, one vote.

890
01:09:56,000 --> 01:10:08,0000
Next step. Okay. We shouldn't. I don't know what time it is, but we still have at least two important points.

891
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:16,0000
One is we are both, on the one hand, critical of China, People's Republic, the big one,

892
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:23,0000
but at the same time we don't simply buy the Western narrative, you know,

893
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:27,0000
the civil totalitarian China, the threat and so on.

894
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:35,0000
This afternoon we talked about a figure, I suppose you, well, go to Google and search for him,

895
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:41,0000
Wang Kuning, who is now probably the most influential intellectual in the world

896
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:48,0000
because in China the real power is in the seven members of the sitting committee of the Politburo.

897
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:55,0000
He is one of them. It's an extremely... Is he the modern version of Suslov?

898
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:58,0000
Do you remember Suslov?

899
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:06,0000
Don't. Now we are entering erotic season because Suslov is my favorite.

900
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:09,0000
Now you will have to suffer one minute. I didn't know that.

901
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:17,0000
Yes. You know why? You know who was Mikhail Suslov, the embodiment of the irrationality of Soviet system.

902
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:23,0000
He was extremely influential, but you know what was his function? He survived them all.

903
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:31,0000
Stalin, Khrushchev, Brezhnev. He said these were pre-digital times.

904
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:42,0000
He had, pre-digital times, a couple of shelves with thousands of cards, quotes from Lenin, for all occasions.

905
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:49,0000
If, for example, Russia wanted a war with Finland, '39, he found a quote from Lenin.

906
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:50,0000
That worked.

907
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:59,0000
And all of them, from Stalin onwards, came to him. This is the party line, finds quotes from Lenin to...

908
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:00,0000
To support it.

909
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:07,0000
To support it. And it's incredible how what he did didn't have any influence.

910
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:08,0000
It's a bit like the Bible.

911
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:09,0000
Yeah.

912
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:13,0000
You can support anything. There's some line in the Bible that supports whatever you do.

913
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:23,0000
Yeah, yeah. So, Suslov, yes. And I wonder if we ever get close to power. I want to be Suslov, not you.

914
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,0000
But that's another story. Okay, sorry.

915
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:32,0000
If we go close anywhere near power, I'll be in the Gulag, and he'll be in the Politburo.

916
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:38,0000
Absolutely. And I will repeat my joke. I told this to Peter Sloterdijk already.

917
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:44,0000
And even if you are in Gulag, I will still show my friendship to you. You know how?

918
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:53,0000
In Gulag, every Sunday, you get a little bit better soup. Two rotten heads of a fish or something like that.

919
01:12:53,000 --> 01:13:01,0000
I will make a call from Moscow. You will get double portion of this soup every Sunday.

920
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,0000
But let's go on on serious stuff.

921
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:13,0000
No, this guy in China, Wang Kuning, he wrote 30 years ago in the late 80s.

922
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:21,0000
He visited for a couple of months United States, studied everyday life and so on,

923
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:32,0000
and wrote a book, "America Against America," where he, what he wrote there is today with Trump and so on,

924
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:40,0000
more true than ever. He saw the creativity, but at the same time the decadent,

925
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:45,0000
self-destroying elements of the American system.

926
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:52,0000
And his big fear was, if China is exploding in this new capitalism,

927
01:13:52,000 --> 01:14:00,0000
how to prevent Americanization in this destructive aspect.

928
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:03,0000
That's the reason, it's not simple totalitarianism.

929
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:11,0000
He is the ideologist, so media claim, behind what President Xi is doing now.

930
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:21,0000
Which is what? Remember, a double, at two levels, this so-called, but we wrongly call them like this, reforms.

931
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:25,0000
I was shocked, I cannot but repeat the joke that I already told it to you.

932
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:34,0000
I said, I read that the Chinese authorities party prohibited something called 996.

933
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:41,0000
Now, I was a little bit shocked from my decadent late 60s sexual revolution years.

934
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:45,0000
I didn't participate in it, but I knew what's going on.

935
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:51,0000
6-9 was associated with double oral sex, you know.

936
01:14:51,000 --> 01:15:00,0000
So I said, what's happening? Like, the political party prohibiting certain sexual practices, no?

937
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,0000
No, then I learned, it's a very sad story.

938
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:08,0000
996 means the practice imposed by big corporations in China.

939
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:13,0000
Six days a week you work 12 hours, 9-9.

940
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:23,0000
But I wasn't totally wrong in my reading, because this guy, Wang Huning, openly describes himself as a neoconservative.

941
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:31,0000
He even, between the lines, delivers an insight with which I fully agree.

942
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:41,0000
That, and Alain, but you hate me for saying this, that the real cause of this exploding capitalism in China

943
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:50,0000
was the big cultural revolution, which destroyed tradition and create, you know, empty subjects.

944
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:56,0000
The big thing during cultural revolution was destroy monuments, get rid of Confucian past, and so on.

945
01:15:56,000 --> 01:16:09,0000
So now Wang Huning's problem is how to keep the capitalist dynamic, but with more justice, more moral authority, and so on, and so on.

946
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:19,0000
I just described the situation which you should read about others, my question to you, can it, will it work, does it have a chance?

947
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,0000
Does what have a chance? China?

948
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:31,0000
No, this strategy specific, let's call it neoconservative strategy, of combining, keeping capitalist dynamic,

949
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:36,0000
but Wang Huning emphasizes also cultural values, and so on, you know.

950
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:39,0000
I don't think it does, I don't think it does have a chance.

951
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:40,0000
Sorry?

952
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:41,0000
I don't think it does.

953
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:45,0000
I also, but why not? This is my feminine intuition, you are the man here.

954
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:52,0000
I have no idea, but I will start speaking, giving an answer, hoping that I will form it by the time I reach the end of the sentence.

955
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:53,0000
Is that okay?

956
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,0000
So you're talking like a Hegelian, okay.

957
01:16:55,000 --> 01:17:03,0000
Okay, well, to begin with, let me make a political statement about China.

958
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,0000
I am a liberal Marxist.

959
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:13,0000
In China I would probably be under house arrest or even worse, probably in some cell.

960
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:22,0000
When the Hong Kong polytechnic students rose up and they were brutally beaten by police, I supported them.

961
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:35,0000
When it comes to the Uyghurs, Tibet, and so on, I'm more than happy to come out and condemn with all my strength the authoritarianism of the Chinese Communist Party.

962
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:44,0000
But at the same time, folks, Trump, Trump started a new Cold War against China.

963
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:50,0000
It was his choice, his geostrategic and ideological choice.

964
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:56,0000
He even went against Apple for producing iPhones in Shenzhen.

965
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,0000
It was a Trumpian choice.

966
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:03,0000
I'm not saying that it's wrong because it was Trump, but I remind you that this was Trump's choice.

967
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:08,0000
Biden comes along and he adopts it completely and actually turbocharges it as well.

968
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:19,0000
So there is an attempt now to create a new Cold War, which could even become hot with the stupidity about Taiwan and so on, because they're upping the ante there.

969
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:27,0000
And you can see that the European Union is being forced, it's been dragged into this with Huawei to begin with.

970
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:40,0000
They banned any European country from having dealings with Huawei, even though Huawei had the best 5G system and the cheapest for our poorer countries, who've not been allowed to use it by the Americans, through Brussels.

971
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:46,0000
And there is an attempt to present China as the new Nazi regime.

972
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:50,0000
This is all dangerous stuff.

973
01:18:50,000 --> 01:19:02,0000
China is a very large country with ambition, a long memory, but they are not imperialist.

974
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,0000
They have never been imperialist.

975
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:09,0000
China has never colonized any place in the world.

976
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:16,0000
Even the skirmish with Vietnam was a skirmish about local issues.

977
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,0000
It was not an attempt to take over Vietnam.

978
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:24,0000
If they wanted to take over Vietnam, they would have taken over Vietnam.

979
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,0000
People say to me, what about Africa?

980
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:30,0000
Wherever you go in Africa, you find Chinese investment.

981
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:40,0000
Well, yes, the Chinese have a strategy of securing supplies of raw materials that they don't have.

982
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:55,0000
A long time ago, it was 2005, I was in Ethiopia, and I was told by government officials that the airport, brand new airport back then, was built by the Chinese government for free.

983
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:57,0000
OK, why are they doing that?

984
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:58,0000
For free.

985
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,0000
The Americans have never built anything for free anyway.

986
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:07,0000
When you hear the words "U.S. aid," it's not aid, it's loans to be paid with interest, not same.

987
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:17,0000
The reason is that they went to Angola, they went to Ethiopia, they went to wherever they thought they could find rare earths or oil or gas.

988
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:23,0000
And they put the governments and the people in their debt by building infrastructure,

989
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:36,0000
hoping that when the deal would be made for all these natural resources, they would get preferential treatment.

990
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:44,0000
OK, this is using one's exorbitant power in one's favor.

991
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:48,0000
But compare and contrast with what the Europeans did in Africa.

992
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:51,0000
We destroyed a whole continent.

993
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,0000
We enslaved their people.

994
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:56,0000
We killed Lumumba.

995
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:59,0000
Not we, but imperialism did.

996
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:01,0000
We created South Africa.

997
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:03,0000
We created, Europeans created South Africa.

998
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:09,0000
It was not the Africans who created apartheid.

999
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:12,0000
You know, think of American imperialism.

1000
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:16,0000
My country was a fascist dictatorship under the CIA.

1001
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:21,0000
Chile, Iran, Mosaddegh and so on.

1002
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:25,0000
What audacity to be accusing the Chinese of being imperialist.

1003
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:26,0000
They're doing business.

1004
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:30,0000
I remember when I was dealing with them as finance minister,

1005
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:39,0000
the troika had imposed upon the previous government that we give the port of Piraeus to Costco, a state-owned Chinese company.

1006
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:40,0000
Of course they took it.

1007
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,0000
They wanted it.

1008
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:43,0000
Right?

1009
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:44,0000
Whose fault was that?

1010
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:47,0000
It was the fault of the European troika and the American troika,

1011
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:51,0000
forcing the Greek government to give the port of Piraeus to Costco.

1012
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:55,0000
When I became minister, for a short period of time,

1013
01:21:55,000 --> 01:22:01,0000
the people at Costco and the Chinese government thought that I had power.

1014
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,0000
So did I for a few minutes.

1015
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:04,0000
Okay?

1016
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:08,0000
And when I negotiated with them, I said I will tear up the contract.

1017
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:13,0000
And I want completely different terms.

1018
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:21,0000
Hugely in our favor, new terms, like a loan of 10 billion,

1019
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:26,0000
massive investment that they had not agreed to put into the port,

1020
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:32,0000
and moving beyond the port creating super fast railway that we don't have in Greece,

1021
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:35,0000
which we don't have.

1022
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:38,0000
And they said yes to everything.

1023
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:43,0000
Now, if that is imperialism, let's have a little bit more of it.

1024
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:48,0000
And you see that there is a lot of investment, and some of it is not good.

1025
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:53,0000
In Serbia, for instance, in Montenegro, where they go in there,

1026
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:57,0000
they give loans with 4% interest rate, which is very high for these days.

1027
01:22:57,000 --> 01:23:01,0000
Why are they getting into southern and eastern Europe?

1028
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:04,0000
Because Europe is not investing.

1029
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,0000
There is a vacuum.

1030
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,0000
The European Union is not investing. Chinese money comes in.

1031
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,0000
They don't bring in troops.

1032
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,0000
They do not overthrow our governments.

1033
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,0000
They do not spy on our politicians.

1034
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,0000
So let's be very clear.

1035
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:21,0000
The Chinese Communist Party's authoritarianism needs to be countered and criticized.

1036
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:26,0000
All the crimes against the Uighurs and so on have to be called out.

1037
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,0000
I'm making no excuses for them.

1038
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:31,0000
But at the same time, no Cold War.

1039
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:34,0000
What the Americans are doing there is twofold.

1040
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:40,0000
First, they want one thing, to take over their big tech.

1041
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:43,0000
Because big tech is American.

1042
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:46,0000
Google, Facebook and so on, they're all American.

1043
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:49,0000
Europe has no competitors. Zero.

1044
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:52,0000
We are a desert when it comes to big tech.

1045
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:55,0000
And since big tech is going to be the future, the future will be American.

1046
01:23:55,000 --> 01:24:01,0000
It will not be European, because we've decided not to invest here in Europe.

1047
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:11,0000
The only country that has worthy competitors to Amazon, Alibaba, to Google, to Uber and so on, are the Chinese.

1048
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:15,0000
Because they've created a space in which they invested.

1049
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:20,0000
And their banking system, which they are not allowing Wall Street to take over.

1050
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:30,0000
What the United States regime wants, from Trump to Biden, is to take over Chinese finance and Chinese big tech.

1051
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:38,0000
While trying to sell lots of armaments to Australia, to New Zealand, in the Pacific.

1052
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:43,0000
You heard about the deal with the so-called Acas deal with the British and so on.

1053
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:47,0000
Which left Macron very peeved.

1054
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:48,0000
Right?

1055
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:58,0000
So this is arms deals and taking over the big tech and finance industries that the Chinese people have built up.

1056
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:02,0000
With a lot of care and with a great deal of ingenuity.

1057
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,0000
Do we want to be part of this? I don't think so.

1058
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:09,0000
Now, that was my statement. I had to make a political statement. I am a politician after all.

1059
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:20,0000
But to your question, I think that the attempt to create an authoritarian, conservative, Confucian, whatever you want to call it, system in China is going to fail.

1060
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:28,0000
Because in the end, the development of the means of production always clash with the antiquated social relations and prejudices.

1061
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,0000
Sounds familiar.

1062
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:31,0000
Familiar, eh?

1063
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:34,0000
The German guy said that.

1064
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:37,0000
Yes, the German guy said that.

1065
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:41,0000
And President Xi already is showing signs of realizing that.

1066
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:44,0000
The other day he came up with a remarkable statement.

1067
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:45,0000
A remarkable statement.

1068
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:52,0000
I really thought this guy or somebody behind him who wrote this text understands stuff.

1069
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:59,0000
He said the only way we are going to increase the wages of Chinese workers is if we reduce the growth rate of China.

1070
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:01,0000
You never hear an American president say that.

1071
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:03,0000
Or a German president say that.

1072
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:05,0000
Or chancellor.

1073
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:21,0000
So he understands that what's going on in China is you have high huge growth rates which they engineered, but at the same time to have those huge growth rates there was a very strong class war against the working class of China.

1074
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:24,0000
And now what he's saying is we need to ameliorate for that.

1075
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:25,0000
We need to rebalance it.

1076
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:29,0000
We need to turn the tables against the capitalists of China.

1077
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:34,0000
And this is the Chinese Communist Party that created the capitalists of China.

1078
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:35,0000
So it's very interesting.

1079
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:45,0000
And I don't think that it will be easy to contain the progressive forces within China in the way that the Confucian right wingers would like.

1080
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,0000
I agree with you here.

1081
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:51,0000
And just to supplement, maybe all of you, you should know this.

1082
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:52,0000
Don't know.

1083
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:53,0000
You know.

1084
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:54,0000
Know.

1085
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,0000
I mean the same position as you.

1086
01:26:56,000 --> 01:27:13,0000
For example, since I also signed some manifests against Hong Kong brutality and especially against some students in Beijing universities who went who wanted to organize workers who were dying of pollution.

1087
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:14,0000
The new Marxists.

1088
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:15,0000
Sorry?

1089
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:16,0000
The new Marxists.

1090
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:17,0000
They disappeared.

1091
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:18,0000
They literally.

1092
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:19,0000
One story.

1093
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:20,0000
I knew one.

1094
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:21,0000
I was in contact.

1095
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:22,0000
He disappeared.

1096
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,0000
His mother inquired too much.

1097
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:25,0000
What happened to him?

1098
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:27,0000
The result is well known.

1099
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:29,0000
If you are a Hegelian, negation of negation.

1100
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:30,0000
She disappeared.

1101
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:39,0000
But what I want.

1102
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:41,0000
What you have immediately.

1103
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:42,0000
I will not be long.

1104
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:50,0000
What you have to remember is nonetheless this is a big as you said non-imperialist trauma of China.

1105
01:27:50,000 --> 01:28:07,0000
Do you know that in eighteen hundred twenty China was not per capita but absolute product by far the economically strongest country in the world three times stronger than Great Britain.

1106
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,0000
And do you know which was the second one?

1107
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:10,0000
No.

1108
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:11,0000
India.

1109
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:12,0000
Yeah.

1110
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:13,0000
Yeah.

1111
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:16,0000
And do you know that something happened.

1112
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:21,0000
This was big business in Bengal.

1113
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:29,0000
Enormous amount of opium were grown to be to be exported to China.

1114
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:31,0000
This was not a couple of merchants.

1115
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:33,0000
This was because they wanted tea.

1116
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:36,0000
The British wanted tea from China because it was the best tea.

1117
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:37,0000
Yeah.

1118
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:39,0000
And Indian tea was rubbish.

1119
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:44,0000
So they grew opium in India and exported it to China in exchange.

1120
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:47,0000
Yeah. And then now comes the horror.

1121
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:54,0000
The Chinese emperor wrote even desperate letters to the young Queen Victoria and so on.

1122
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:55,0000
She even didn't answer him.

1123
01:28:55,000 --> 01:29:03,0000
So the Chinese emperor just just prohibited the import of opium.

1124
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:04,0000
The result you know.

1125
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:14,0000
Great Britain with the help of some other Western powers attacked China with the wonderful justification.

1126
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:18,0000
It was that free trade is the basis of civilization.

1127
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:21,0000
If some country breaks this rule it's returning.

1128
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:23,0000
It's becoming barbarian.

1129
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:25,0000
It has to be forced to be re-civilized.

1130
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:26,0000
Now comes the tragedy.

1131
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:39,0000
Do you know that in 1840-50 over half, around two thirds of Chinese BMP, Brut national product, disappeared?

1132
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:44,0000
It was an undescribable economic social catastrophe.

1133
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,0000
To imagine what it is.

1134
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:49,0000
And I like to sell this to Americans.

1135
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:50,0000
I haven't been to...

1136
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:54,0000
Like imagine today moral worth is the same.

1137
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,0000
I like this idea.

1138
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:59,0000
Who are the greatest...

1139
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:02,0000
Colombia and who produces...

1140
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:11,0000
Colombia and Mexico declaring war on United States because they try to stop opium exports from this country.

1141
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:13,0000
This is what they did.

1142
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:24,0000
So you know what I'm saying is that as you I disagree with many things the Chinese are doing.

1143
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:35,0000
But the problems they are trying to deal with in this way are my god, are the real problems of today.

1144
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:36,0000
Okay.

1145
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:40,0000
To gradually conclude, do you want to add something here?

1146
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:43,0000
I would like a few questions from the audience.

1147
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:46,0000
They will after I finish.

1148
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,0000
They will all be dead then.

1149
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:49,0000
Sorry.

1150
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:50,0000
No, no, no.

1151
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:56,0000
What I want to say is just to clarify the last point where we are as it were in the same seat.

1152
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:57,0000
Okay.

1153
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:58,0000
Which is...

1154
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:04,0000
And then the people are allowed their three minutes of let's play democracy.

1155
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:05,0000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1156
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:06,0000
Let's play democracy.

1157
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:13,0000
You know we were both absurdly accused of anti-Semitism and so on and all that.

1158
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:15,0000
But it's absurd.

1159
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:20,0000
But what I want to draw your attention and it's especially maybe you were not yet told,

1160
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:32,0000
actually also here in Slovenia where we have a government now which is officially totally pro-Israel.

1161
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:39,0000
When there was that last conflict with Hamas on the West Bank, you know that Slovenia was...

1162
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:40,0000
Yugoslavia, he said.

1163
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:41,0000
Together with...

1164
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:42,0000
I got that.

1165
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:48,0000
Slovenia was together with Hungary, the only country which on all official buildings put

1166
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:53,0000
together with Slovene and European flag also the Israeli flag.

1167
01:31:53,000 --> 01:32:02,0000
Now in some recent scandals European Union exploded against our prime minister about some remarks

1168
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:08,0000
which can be anti-Semitic and so on can be read in that way and our defense was, but how?

1169
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,0000
We totally support Israel.

1170
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:15,0000
What they don't get is, and that's my question to you, would you buy this?

1171
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:21,0000
I'm more and more convinced of it and all my Israeli friends agree with it.

1172
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:31,0000
One of the basic paradoxes today is the paradox of, mark my words, Zionist anti-Semitism.

1173
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:35,0000
You find it already, it's incredible.

1174
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:45,0000
You should read Theodor Herz, Der Judenstaat, where he says already this formula that all

1175
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:54,0000
anti-Semitic right wingers like, let's get rid of Jews here, send them to Palestine,

1176
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:59,0000
in this way we get rid of them, but there they will bring Western civilization, they

1177
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:02,0000
will be a wall against primitivism and so on.

1178
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:06,0000
You know who wrote, I quoted in my text, the same idea.

1179
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:09,0000
Yes, that guy, Reinhard Heydrich.

1180
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:14,0000
He said, we fully support Jews who want a state there.

1181
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,0000
They will defend Western values, blah, blah.

1182
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,0000
We just don't want them here.

1183
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:23,0000
Breivik, you remember the Norwegian madman, said the same thing.

1184
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:29,0000
And the tragic thing, I cannot even imagine the consequences, is that the Israeli government

1185
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:31,0000
is playing this game.

1186
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:32,0000
Look at Trump.

1187
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:33,0000
He was the model of this.

1188
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:38,0000
He fully supported Israeli expansionism.

1189
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:44,0000
At the same time, he has openly flirted in the United States with anti-Semitic.

1190
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:45,0000
With Nazis.

1191
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:46,0000
With Nazis.

1192
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:47,0000
With Nazis, yes.

1193
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:54,0000
This is, I think, one of the saddest aspects of the terrible situation we are in.

1194
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:55,0000
Okay.

1195
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:56,0000
I said my thing.

1196
01:33:56,000 --> 01:34:00,0000
Well, let me say my thing too here because I need to make it clear.

1197
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,0000
These are difficult times.

1198
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:06,0000
I know.

1199
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:12,0000
Once upon a time, when the establishment wanted to assassinate our character, the character

1200
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:22,0000
of left-wingers, of difficult people like us, they called us communists, okay, or subversives,

1201
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:23,0000
or Marxists.

1202
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:26,0000
I don't mind being called these things.

1203
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,0000
I am all those things.

1204
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,0000
I confess.

1205
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:37,0000
Then they discovered another way of getting at us, to call us things that hurt, to call

1206
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:39,0000
me a misogynist.

1207
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:41,0000
I consider myself to be a staunch feminist.

1208
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:43,0000
I come from a long line of feminist women.

1209
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:48,0000
My grandmother was a suffragette in the 1920s in Cairo, in Egypt, for God's sakes.

1210
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:51,0000
My mother was an active feminist.

1211
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:53,0000
I consider myself to be a feminist.

1212
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:59,0000
To be called a misogynist, even if I know it is completely made up, it hurts.

1213
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:02,0000
To be called an anti-Semite, it hurts.

1214
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:10,0000
Because I would wear the Star of David here whenever a Jew faces persecution for being

1215
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,0000
a Jew.

1216
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:21,0000
But at the same time, now we are in a situation where, look at my friend Ken Loach, Jeremy

1217
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:30,0000
Robin, to bring us down, our political opponents, immediately slap this accusation on us simply

1218
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,0000
because we are opposing apartheid.

1219
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:37,0000
Because the problem I have with Israel is that it is an apartheid state.

1220
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:46,0000
I spent my youth in London being beaten up with others in Hyde Park demonstrating against

1221
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:51,0000
apartheid when Mandela was in prison and Margaret Thatcher was calling him a terrorist.

1222
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:53,0000
Right?

1223
01:35:53,000 --> 01:36:03,0000
I never imagined that apartheid would die in South Africa and be reconvened in Palestine.

1224
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:13,0000
Calling out apartheid, by the way, I have to give my thanks and great appreciation to

1225
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:20,0000
our comrades in Israel, the Bezalem Organization, the Human Rights Jewish Organization, that

1226
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:26,0000
were the first who dared call Israel an apartheid state.

1227
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:37,0000
So, having made this point, I am not surprised by what you say.

1228
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:43,0000
The worst enemies of the people of Greece were Greeks.

1229
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:50,0000
Every time we have been defeated, we have been defeated not by ironclad foreign armies,

1230
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,0000
but by our own folks.

1231
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:57,0000
From time immemorial, even when the Persians invaded, half of the Greek city-states went

1232
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:58,0000
with the Persians.

1233
01:36:58,000 --> 01:36:59,0000
Half of them.

1234
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:01,0000
It's not the heroic Sparta.

1235
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:02,0000
No, Thebes.

1236
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:03,0000
Thebes was an ally.

1237
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:04,0000
Thebes, next to Athens.

1238
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:08,0000
A stone's throw from Athens, an ally of the Persians.

1239
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,0000
No wonder they produced the Greek troops.

1240
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:17,0000
During the occupation, it was the collaborators that did the most damage, not the Germans.

1241
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:21,0000
People ask me about 2015, why did you lose against the Troika?

1242
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:23,0000
Was it because Shoaib Ali was so harsh?

1243
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:25,0000
No, of course not.

1244
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:28,0000
I knew exactly how harsh the IMF and Shoaib Ali would be.

1245
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,0000
It was our own people.

1246
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:34,0000
It was the vision within our ranks and the fact that the Greek oligarchy was absolutely

1247
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:39,0000
determined that the Greek people get defeated and that we become a dead colony in which

1248
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:40,0000
they...

1249
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:47,0000
So, you know, this is not an exceptionalist argument about the Zionist anti-Semites.

1250
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:55,0000
It's everywhere, except that the plight of the Palestinian people is so much greater

1251
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:59,0000
than the plight of any other people because they have been completely forgotten.

1252
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:07,0000
The collapse of the Soviet Union was a mighty blow because they were on the losing side

1253
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:09,0000
of the Cold War.

1254
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:17,0000
You had the migration of Russian Jews, strengthening the demographics and so on, and you have the

1255
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:24,0000
abomination of Saddam Hussein trying to present himself as the defender of the Palestinians.

1256
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:30,0000
Having a butcher defend your rights is the worst thing that can happen to you, right?

1257
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:38,0000
And you have a situation where, until the latest uprising, most of my Palestinian friends

1258
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:45,0000
and Jewish friends who support the Palestinian cause felt that the cause was dying day by

1259
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:46,0000
day.

1260
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:52,0000
But this very poignant uprising has created new hope.

1261
01:38:52,000 --> 01:39:01,0000
New hope in purely Hegelian style of the liberation of the Jews of Israel.

1262
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:10,0000
Because the worst victims after the Palestinians are progressive Jews in Israel who live under

1263
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:13,0000
a Netanyahu kind of regime.

1264
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:20,0000
They are prisoners of an Israel that is completely against the interests of progressive Jews.

1265
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,0000
Agree?

1266
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,0000
Just before you should say...

1267
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,0000
No, no, I will not say anything.

1268
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:27,0000
Just give...

1269
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:29,0000
You know what we totally neglected?

1270
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:31,0000
You are not politically a nobody.

1271
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:33,0000
You have now DM and progressive...

1272
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:35,0000
I am not politically a nobody.

1273
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:36,0000
Almost nobody.

1274
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:37,0000
The negation of the negation.

1275
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:38,0000
Yeah, yeah.

1276
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:45,0000
But, my God, it fascinated me so much how that progressive international that you mentioned,

1277
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:50,0000
it's not just like a group of Trotskyist meeting in a basement.

1278
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:52,0000
It's something serious going on.

1279
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:55,0000
Please tell them in one minute.

1280
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:57,0000
It started...

1281
01:39:57,000 --> 01:40:00,0000
You know that I've been involved in DM25, which is a pan-European movement.

1282
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:05,0000
We ran in elections in Greece and elected nine members of parliament.

1283
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:12,0000
But in the middle of doing all this, I was invited to...

1284
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:18,0000
by The Guardian to write a comment on an article by Bernie Sanders in 2018.

1285
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:19,0000
Bernie Sanders...

1286
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:21,0000
No, actually the other way around.

1287
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:25,0000
I was invited to write an article about what I think the problem of the world is.

1288
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:27,0000
How The Guardian does that.

1289
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:30,0000
So I said the problem is the twin authoritarianisms.

1290
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:34,0000
The authoritarianism of the liberal establishment and the authoritarianism of the fascists.

1291
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:41,0000
And what we need is a progressive international because the bankers and the fascists are internationalizing

1292
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:43,0000
only the progressives are internationalizing.

1293
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:45,0000
So we need a progressive international.

1294
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:47,0000
And they gave this to Bernie Sanders and they asked him to comment.

1295
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:50,0000
He provided a very nice comment saying that it was right and so on.

1296
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,0000
And then they asked... they liked that.

1297
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:56,0000
So they had the idea that they would ask him to write an article with me commenting.

1298
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:58,0000
So the two were published like that.

1299
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:01,0000
The two articles and the two comments.

1300
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:02,0000
And then we got together.

1301
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:03,0000
Bernie Sanders.

1302
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:05,0000
Bernie Sanders was actually wonderful in 2015.

1303
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:10,0000
He lent me enormous support during these negotiations with the Tricke.

1304
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:18,0000
He even threatened Christine Lagarde in the IMF that as a senator he would start the process of starving the IMF for funding

1305
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:20,0000
if he continued doing what they were doing in Greece.

1306
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,0000
Which is remarkable.

1307
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:26,0000
Not that he had the power to do it but it was nice that he... it was a good thought.

1308
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:30,0000
Well he's one senator out of a cent.

1309
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:33,0000
But it was, you know, it was extremely helpful.

1310
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:39,0000
So we got in touch and we said okay well enough talking.

1311
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:43,0000
If we both agree that we should have a progressive international let's have it.

1312
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:47,0000
So a few months later we met in Vermont.

1313
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:49,0000
It was a wonderful gathering.

1314
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:52,0000
All the good comrades, all the usual suspects.

1315
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:57,0000
You know, Cornel West, Susan Sarandon, Bernie Sanders,

1316
01:41:57,000 --> 01:42:00,0000
Jakob's daughter, the Prime Minister of Iceland and so on.

1317
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,0000
So we made an open call.

1318
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:05,0000
Then something horrible happened and the whole thing was suspended.

1319
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:08,0000
It's called the American election.

1320
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:12,0000
Because the American election means that Bernie could not participate in this.

1321
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:13,0000
I don't know whether you know that.

1322
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:17,0000
If you're a candidate in the United States you cannot participate in any international organization.

1323
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:19,0000
Did you know that?

1324
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:24,0000
So much for, you know, worldliness of the American political system.

1325
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:29,0000
So we put this on ice for a while and then we recovered it.

1326
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:34,0000
And a year and a half ago we launched properly the progressive international.

1327
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:38,0000
And we got a lot of work which most people don't know about.

1328
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:45,0000
But the whole point is to organize a common agenda of progressives

1329
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:48,0000
and also a common set of actions, not just talk.

1330
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:52,0000
Because the World Social Forum was great in the sense that we go together once a year,

1331
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:55,0000
we chatted and then we forgot about it.

1332
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:59,0000
We were so impressed with ourselves that we forgot about it.

1333
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:02,0000
It's a question of doing stuff as well.

1334
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:10,0000
Now the first action we carried out in December on that horrible day called Black Friday,

1335
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:15,0000
which is, you know, the great sale of the American consumerist machine

1336
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:18,0000
which has been expanded and brought to Europe as well.

1337
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:22,0000
So on that day we decided to target Amazon.

1338
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:26,0000
And we had a campaign called Make Amazon Pay.

1339
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:34,0000
And by that time we had gathered trade unions and other organizations,

1340
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:41,0000
climate change activists and so on, all sorts of different movements.

1341
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:48,0000
And they joined the progressive international to the extent that we ended up with 200 million affiliated members.

1342
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:56,0000
So to test the water and to test our capacity to act globally as a progressive international,

1343
01:43:56,000 --> 01:44:00,0000
on that day we had a rolling strike in Amazon warehouses.

1344
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:05,0000
It started in Bangladesh, it moved to India, jumped to Germany,

1345
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:12,0000
from Germany to New Jersey and from New Jersey to Seattle with artistic events at the same time,

1346
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:20,0000
projections on buildings on Jeff Bezos' house, we projected Make Amazon Pay.

1347
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:22,0000
It's a great picture of that.

1348
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:26,0000
The headquarters in Seattle, Make Amazon Pay.

1349
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:29,0000
So, you know, and now we're continuing.

1350
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:34,0000
We have a meeting happening in March in Chile where everybody gets together.

1351
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:39,0000
We have, you know, people like Rafael Correa, a member of that.

1352
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:44,0000
You are a member of that, you don't know it but you are.

1353
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:48,0000
You know, Lula from Brazil.

1354
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:55,0000
But also the most important thing is we have young activists from Africa and from Bangladesh and from India.

1355
01:44:55,000 --> 01:45:03,0000
And you should hear them speak when they take the floor, you know, 18, 19-year-old kids from Kenya and from Ghana.

1356
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:11,0000
It's, you know, it makes getting up in the morning and doing stuff worthwhile.

1357
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:14,0000
I cannot agree more. Thank you very much.

1358
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:23,0000
[Applause]

1359
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:31,0000
Now, since I am a little bit meopic, would you, how we should organize it?

1360
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:36,0000
Before you give the mic, before you give the mic, before you, don't hand it over yet.

1361
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:41,0000
It will have to be a woman that speaks first.

1362
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:45,0000
Enough of men. And then a man.

1363
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:53,0000
And then Luca.

1364
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:57,0000
It's an honor to hear you live, not just on YouTube.

1365
01:45:57,000 --> 01:46:08,0000
I have a question concerning Europe's enlargement processes and how and where does this fit Europe's economic agenda in context of the capitalism?

1366
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:16,0000
And as you said, countries like China now are more keen on investing in countries like Serbia and Macedonia.

1367
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:22,0000
So what is your standpoint and opinion?

1368
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:30,0000
It's a difficult question because we know why the European Union expanded so quickly.

1369
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:40,0000
It was a kind of, I know this is a terrible term, it was a kind of leberraum, vital space for German and German-related industry.

1370
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:47,0000
That's why Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland came in so quickly.

1371
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:52,0000
They came in because of the expansion of the German industrial machine.

1372
01:46:52,000 --> 01:47:02,0000
Now at the same time, what do you say to people in Poland, in Hungary, in North Macedonia, in Serbia and so on who say,

1373
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:07,0000
you know, we feel that we are going to be more protected in terms of our liberties?

1374
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:14,0000
My response to that is if that's how you feel, by all means come in and we will support you.

1375
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:25,0000
But make no mistake, the dearth of investment across Europe is not going to suddenly be waved away just because Serbia comes in.

1376
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:30,0000
There will be no investment in Serbia in the same way that there is no investment in Croatia.

1377
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:37,0000
How much investment is there in Slovenia? Yes, okay, this building, they paid some of it. Good, great.

1378
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:42,0000
I'm now sounding like Monty Python. And what have the Romans done for us?

1379
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:44,0000
No, no, no, no.

1380
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:51,0000
But nevertheless, the investment is a huge problem. In Germany, they are not investing in Germany.

1381
01:47:51,000 --> 01:48:00,0000
In Germany, it's starved of investment, which is crazy because that country, Germany, has never had so much money as they do now.

1382
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:09,0000
So, as a Greek politician, I have to answer that if it comes to the Greek parliament,

1383
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:16,0000
that one of the former Yugoslav states is coming in, I'll vote yes.

1384
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:29,0000
But I want you folks to think very seriously about the balance of power between your oligarchies and your working classes when you enter.

1385
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:39,0000
You have a very authoritarian, right-wing, problematic, misanthropic government in Serbia, for instance.

1386
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:46,0000
You're suffering under them. It is natural to think you'll get into the European Union and you'll be protected from your own government.

1387
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:53,0000
Maybe it will happen, maybe it won't happen. Maybe the regimes are going to become even more solidified.

1388
01:48:53,000 --> 01:49:09,0000
Look at the liberal democracies of Poland and Hungary. Angela Merkel has bent over backwards to accommodate those fascistic governments.

1389
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:12,0000
And they will continue to do this.

1390
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:18,0000
So, I defer to the peoples of those countries.

1391
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:25,0000
If you want to come in, you'll have my support, but don't think that you'll solve your problems by coming into the European Union.

1392
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:29,0000
Courtesy of coming into the European Union on its own.

1393
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:41,0000
And a lot of work needs to be done. There are instruments in the European Union that you can use for liberty and for progress, but it's not automatic.

1394
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:51,0000
Hello, Vlatka Kolarovic from Zagreb. I would like to ask you a question about us, people, users of these digital platforms you were talking about.

1395
01:49:51,000 --> 01:50:04,0000
Are we creating something in this world or are we just slaves or are we important, like users of all this digital world around us?

1396
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:11,0000
I use digital technologies all the time and I'm fanatical about them. I love them.

1397
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:27,0000
But as a boring old Marxist, I will have to say to you, never fetishize the instrument and never turn against the instrument.

1398
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:33,0000
Turn against the social relations of ownership and production of the instruments.

1399
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:44,0000
So let's change the way in which these technologies are being produced and used, but for goodness sake, use them.

1400
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:53,0000
And use them against those who are providing them to you.

1401
01:50:53,000 --> 01:51:00,0000
Hi. I have a question about Wolfgang Schäuble and a question about the library card ownership of stocks.

1402
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:07,0000
So, Wolfgang Schäuble, what would you have done if you were in his shoes?

1403
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:15,0000
Would you simply do as he did, which seems to me basically to be defending what he thought were German geopolitical interests?

1404
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:22,0000
You see, let me answer this question and you ask this, the man immediately afterwards, because it's going to be very, very brief.

1405
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:29,0000
I would never be in his shoes. They would never put me in his shoes because this is not a personal thing.

1406
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:35,0000
There are certain economic and political interests that wanted somebody like Schäuble.

1407
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:41,0000
I remember a discussion between Noam Chomsky and a BBC journalist.

1408
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:47,0000
And Chomsky was going on quite correctly about the inherent bias of the media.

1409
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:50,0000
And the media tell one story and they will never tell another story.

1410
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:56,0000
And this journalist said to him, a very nice journalist, good Andrew Maher, a good BBC journalist.

1411
01:51:56,000 --> 01:52:04,0000
And he said to him, Professor Chomsky, are you telling me that you think that I am saying things I don't believe in?

1412
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:08,0000
That what I'm saying to you has been imposed upon me by a system?

1413
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:14,0000
And Chomsky turned around and said, no, no, no, no, I am convinced that you believe in what you're saying.

1414
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:19,0000
But if you didn't believe in what you were saying, you would not be having that position.

1415
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:23,0000
So, similarly with Schäuble. So, what's the second question?

1416
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:28,0000
The second question was about the library card ownership of stocks.

1417
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:35,0000
And I was simply wondering if you had any thoughts on Yugoslavia's tradition of self-management.

1418
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:41,0000
And you thought if that was kind of useful in your thoughts.

1419
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:52,0000
Absolutely. The Yugoslav self-management model was an incredible experience for the world.

1420
01:52:52,000 --> 01:53:00,0000
I know people, Americans, who came here in the 1960s to study the Yugoslav self-management model

1421
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:05,0000
because it was a success story. Right-wing economists, not left-wing economists.

1422
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:16,0000
It was ahead of its time because digital technologies are important for the management and governance of self-managed firms.

1423
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:27,0000
The capacity to communicate through fora, through intranets, through apps, to vote is much enhanced when you have digital technology.

1424
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:33,0000
You didn't have that in Yugoslavia. You had to do everything with paper and actual physical meetings of workers,

1425
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:38,0000
which made them, you know, Oscar Wilde, the last so long socialism would never take place.

1426
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:49,0000
There were aspects of the Yugoslav model that I didn't like. Like, for instance, too much hierarchy.

1427
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:56,0000
You elected the hierarchy, but there was far more hierarchy than was necessary.

1428
01:53:56,000 --> 01:54:00,0000
It was an attempt to emulate capitalist enterprises with voting.

1429
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:11,0000
But the reason why the Yugoslav economic model, self-management model, collapsed was not because of its inherent dysfunctionalities.

1430
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:19,0000
It was because the government of Yugoslavia between 1971 and 1975 made a huge error

1431
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:28,0000
of borrowing large, gigantic amounts of money from American and Western banks at an interest rate of 2.5-3%.

1432
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:37,0000
At the moment the oil crisis pushed interest rates to 20%, Yugoslavia was over from an economic point of view.

1433
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:42,0000
I have a question, please.

1434
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:44,0000
Where are you? I can't see you.

1435
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:50,0000
I'm on your right. Hi. So, quite a few years have passed since the Paris Climate Agreement.

1436
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:55,0000
And as we can see, the situation is not getting any better. It's actually getting quite worse.

1437
01:54:55,000 --> 01:55:04,0000
So, how do extreme climate events fit into your progressive agenda if on one hand we have people who are judged by not using linen bags to shop,

1438
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:10,0000
and there we have on the other side Paul Allen who crushes the complete and full coral reef with his super yacht.

1439
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:13,0000
What can we do and what is your agenda that can we use all of?

1440
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:19,0000
Well, firstly, the great concentration of wealth is terrible for the environment. You just gave an example.

1441
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:29,0000
You know, when 1% of the 1% has so much power that they can actually usurp agendas, even green agendas, and they can do plenty of greenwashing.

1442
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:47,0000
I mean, look at the European Union now. Even those ambitious targets include using wood pellets from turning ancient forests into plantations.

1443
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:59,0000
And they call this green. So, when exorbitant power is running the green transition, the green transition is never going to be green.

1444
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:12,0000
The number one priority should be investing in renewable energy and creating a union, a proper union.

1445
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:17,0000
It's remarkable in the European Union that we don't have an energy union. Do you realize that?

1446
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:27,0000
Every country plants its own renewables, which is crazy. You know, just think of how Europe looks from a satellite.

1447
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:34,0000
It's not that huge a place. To have a German plan, an Italian plan, a Slovenian plan, it's madness.

1448
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:43,0000
You know, an extraterrestrial will tell you, go and find one, she will tell you. So, we need...

1449
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:55,0000
Our movement's estimation was that we needed, three years ago, 500 billion euros a year for the green transition, especially when it comes to energy.

1450
01:56:55,000 --> 01:57:01,0000
People say, "Oh, this is a lot of money. Where are we going to find it from?" Well, you're printing it anyway,

1451
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:09,0000
and giving it to Deutsche Bank to give it to Volkswagen to buy its shares. So, there's a very simple way, even within capitalism,

1452
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:15,0000
even within the European Union as we have. We have the European Investment Bank. It's in Luxembourg, the armpit of the universe, right?

1453
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:24,0000
It's there. It's sitting there in Luxembourg. Well, it can borrow money by issuing bonds.

1454
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:31,0000
Well, issue 500 billion worth of bonds on behalf of the whole of Europe. This bank belongs to all of us Europeans, okay?

1455
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:37,0000
And have the European Central Bank support it, even buy those bonds off it if need be.

1456
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:42,0000
So, suddenly you have half a trillion every year to spend on an energy union, but we're not doing any of this.

1457
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:50,0000
And the reason why we're not doing it is because our politicians are in the pockets of the large corporations

1458
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:59,0000
that want to sell their own windmills, right, which are not part of any plan.

1459
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:04,0000
They just go and put a 200-metre windmill on top of a mountain, which is terrible for the mountain.

1460
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:12,0000
The local community hates it. It turns the local community against renewables. And it's not part of an integrated plan.

1461
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:24,0000
And when it rots, this thing, it's not even recyclable. So, it's a question of using Green-Kensianism, if you want.

1462
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:29,0000
You know, these instruments, like the one that I gave an example of, the European Investment Bank, the European Central Bank,

1463
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:32,0000
these public financial instruments, they're tools. We have them.

1464
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:38,0000
Use them to mobilize huge quantities of money and press them into the service of the Green Transition,

1465
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:44,0000
and then moving towards a decentralized, self-managed grid.

1466
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:51,0000
You see the beauty of renewables, unlike oil or natural gas or nuclear.

1467
01:58:51,000 --> 01:59:01,0000
All these need huge factories, economies of scale. So, somebody's going to own them, either the state or some individual or corporation.

1468
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:08,0000
But with renewables, you can have solar panels everywhere, you can have small windmills everywhere,

1469
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:19,0000
you can have hydrogen-producing renewable energy. So, hydrogen will replace diesel in trucks and so on.

1470
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:28,0000
And all these can, the ownership can be dispersed different neighborhoods, owning different cells of that network.

1471
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:36,0000
But that means going against the grain of the interests of corporate capitalism that wants to concentrate all power in their hands.

1472
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:39,0000
One last question.

1473
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:42,0000
And the Vulluka, they...

1474
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:44,0000
Luka.

1475
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:47,0000
[Laughter]

1476
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:48,0000
Okay.

1477
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:52,0000
Is this the end?

1478
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:54,0000
Is this the end?

1479
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:58,0000
[Laughter]

1480
01:59:58,000 --> 02:00:00,0000
Because I want to ironic.

1481
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:04,0000
Okay, if I was given a mic, I will pose a question.

1482
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:12,0000
I believe that it was in 2011 or 2012 when Slavoj, you said that Alixis Tsipras was the most dangerous man in Europe, right?

1483
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:13,0000
Did I?

1484
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:14,0000
Yeah.

1485
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:15,0000
Yeah, yeah.

1486
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:16,0000
But it was...

1487
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:18,0000
The study is the rewriting of history, not just the...

1488
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:19,0000
Self-rewriting of history.

1489
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:20,0000
Yeah, yeah.

1490
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:30,0000
But at that point, I believe it was correct, and I believe you will agree too, because the Southern Europe was more or less going underwater.

1491
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:35,0000
Greece was in financial trouble, Italy was in financial trouble, Spain, Portugal, and so on.

1492
02:00:35,000 --> 02:00:36,0000
We still are.

1493
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:37,0000
Still are.

1494
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:38,0000
Still are.

1495
02:00:38,000 --> 02:01:02,0000
And the gamble of Syriza and Tsipras back then was if we ascend to power and if we threat the European authorities with defaulting, not repaying our debts, the panic on financial markets will spread to Italy and Spain and Portugal and so on, and they will have to change something in their policy towards those countries.

1496
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:11,0000
That was assessment in 2012, and I believe it was correct, and that's why I agree with Slavoj's description of Tsipras at that time.

1497
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:33,0000
However, Syriza have not come to power in 2012, but in 2015, and then, until then, two major things changed.

1498
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:45,0000
First, to save the euro, and second, as if anticipating Syriza coming to power in January 2015, he started with quantitative easing.

1499
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:46,0000
No, first March.

1500
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:47,0000
First March.

1501
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:48,0000
Okay.

1502
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:49,0000
Okay, then it was...

1503
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:54,0000
It's important, because we were already in government, and we could have stopped that.

1504
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:56,0000
See what I'm saying?

1505
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:57,0000
I know.

1506
02:01:57,000 --> 02:01:59,0000
That's why I'm asking.

1507
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:04,0000
When you came to power, Mario Draghi started with quantitative easing.

1508
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:08,0000
That means printing money, buying government bonds.

1509
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:18,0000
So the south of Europe was still underwater, but Mario Draghi came and gave them so-called straws to breathe.

1510
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:24,0000
They could survive underwater, Italy, Spain, and so on, and that's why they're still underwater.

1511
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:28,0000
But a straw was given to everyone, but to Greece.

1512
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:39,0000
My question is, in that circumstances, I believe your game was kind of lost from the beginning.

1513
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:41,0000
No, you weren't here at the beginning, were you?

1514
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:42,0000
I was here at the beginning.

1515
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:44,0000
So you didn't hear what I said about the bonds?

1516
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:45,0000
Yes, that's why I'm asking.

1517
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:54,0000
So my question is, wouldn't a default of Greece, in those circumstances, be just a default of Greece?

1518
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:58,0000
You probably weren't here at the beginning because I explained that.

1519
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:03,0000
We had a Plan B, and we had a nuclear weapon.

1520
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:05,0000
We had a nuclear weapon.

1521
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:11,0000
Now, a nuclear weapon is not always a good thing to have, but nevertheless, on that occasion, it answers your question.

1522
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:15,0000
Because, okay, let's retrace what you said.

1523
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:17,0000
Because up until a point, you were absolutely right.

1524
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:31,0000
Up until the point where in March of 2015, Draghi started spreading money and giving the straw, as you put it, a nice metaphor, to various countries, including France.

1525
02:03:31,000 --> 02:03:37,0000
And allowing them to continue breathing even if we defaulted.

1526
02:03:37,000 --> 02:03:39,0000
That's where you were wrong.

1527
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:53,0000
Because if we defaulted at that point, okay, we're talking about the first few months, if Tsipras had backed me in what we had agreed would be our strategy, you see, Tsipras and I had agreed that that would be our strategy.

1528
02:03:53,000 --> 02:04:08,0000
Because of his great clash with Jens Weidman of the Bundesbank, the only way he was allowed on the 1st of March to start giving the straw to these countries was if no debt that he already owned was written down.

1529
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:13,0000
I owed him 29 billion.

1530
02:04:13,000 --> 02:04:27,0000
I had in my drawer, the right drawer of my desk, I had a ministerial decree by which I postponed the payment of those bonds of 29 billion to 2042.

1531
02:04:27,000 --> 02:04:29,0000
Why? Because of the movie.

1532
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:32,0000
Remember 2042? Science fiction movie.

1533
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:34,0000
Isn't it 2049?

1534
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:38,0000
2049, yeah, something like that.

1535
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:45,0000
That would have meant that Draghi would not be able to buy Italian debt.

1536
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:55,0000
The reason why we lost it was because Tsipras signaled to Draghi that he wouldn't allow me to do it.

1537
02:04:55,000 --> 02:04:59,0000
It's like, you know, you have David and Goliath.

1538
02:04:59,000 --> 02:05:05,0000
David has a chance, a chance of winning the struggle against Goliath.

1539
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:07,0000
He's got a little catapult.

1540
02:05:07,000 --> 02:05:18,0000
But if, as David is going into the battlefield, you take the catapult away from him, then you lose.

1541
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:20,0000
Okay, I would just like to say something.

1542
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:24,0000
I owe you an insult as to all my friends to conclude.

1543
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:33,0000
First, I said that we cannot go on and on because, you know, at the end, at least there was a little bit of disagreement.

1544
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:41,0000
I think that the reason Yugoslavia fell apart was more complex.

1545
02:05:41,000 --> 02:05:43,0000
Of course. I said economically.

1546
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:54,0000
Because, you know, the big enigma is why Yugoslavia, which was held up as the most democratic, open, blah, blah, blah, paid the most horrible price with the civil war.

1547
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:55,0000
But let's drop that.

1548
02:05:55,000 --> 02:06:08,0000
Now, really to conclude, I will strike back at you with Monty Python, the same joke, you know, from, no, it's not, it's from the Life of Brian movie, I think, no?

1549
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:09,0000
Yeah, I like that.

1550
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:13,0000
They have this Palestinian. What did the Romans do for us?

1551
02:06:13,000 --> 02:06:14,0000
You know, nothing.

1552
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:15,0000
Bridges.

1553
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:19,0000
Yes, yes. And now I will say to you, what did Yanis do for us here?

1554
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:21,0000
Nothing. Okay.

1555
02:06:21,000 --> 02:06:25,0000
He explained very well the Syriza situation.

1556
02:06:25,000 --> 02:06:30,0000
He gave us a wonderful overview of today's capitalism.

1557
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:33,0000
He and so on and so on.

1558
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:35,0000
But overall, it was nothing.

1559
02:06:35,000 --> 02:06:36,0000
So thank you.

1560
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:37,0000
Thank you.

1561
02:06:37,000 --> 02:06:42,0000
Thank you.

1562
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:43,0000
Aristo.

1563
02:06:43,000 --> 02:06:48,0000
Thank you very much and see you next time.

1564
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:49,0000
Yeah.

1565
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:50,0000
Thank you.

1566
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:53,0000
Thank you.

1567
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:55,0000
Thank you.

1568
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:57,0000
Thank you.

1569
02:06:59,000 --> 02:07:00,0000
Thank you.

1570
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:03,0000
Thank you.

1571
02:07:05,000 --> 02:07:06,0000
Thank you.

1572
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:09,0000
Thank you.
